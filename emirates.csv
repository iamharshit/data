1,November 2022,Chennai to Chicago via Dubai,Solo Leisure,S Hayter,6th November 2022,7,na,4,2,3,3,2,Business Class,3,na,Trip Verified,Meal service was super slow," Overall business class is quite good with friendly and polite flight staff. Few cons: seats are quite narrow. I'm 5'4"", 125 pounds and my elbows were hitting either side. You can lay on your back quite comfortably but I don't know how a bigger person will be comfortable especially on long haul flights. In each of the 4 legs at every meal time, the flight attendant asked me "" do you want to eat dinner/ lunch/ brunch?"". Of course I would. Where would I go for sustenance on a 15 hour flight? It's not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn't really a vegan meal. For a $5k ticket, I'd have hoped Emirates would've been a little creative and thoughtful with the vegan meal. "

I couldn't change my flight tickets for 2.5 weeks! They changed me a few hours before departure and took a fine of 200 euros. If you want to ruin your trip and vacation, contact Emirates, they will do it professionally!"

I really can not fault the airline at all. The cabin crew are extremely attentive, polite and friendly. The food was very tasty. In flight entertainment was very extensive for two 6 hours flights."
4,October 2022,London to Colombo via Dubai,Couple Leisure,Mohammed Ramzan,29th October 2022,5,na,2,1,2,1,2,Economy Class,2,1,Not Verified,treat every passenger the same," When travelling from Dubai to Srilanka and  from Srilanka to Dubai with Emirates and from London to Dubai and  Dubai to London is travelling with 2 different Airlines. Aircraft, the service, food is 1st class when travelling from Europe but  completely different services when travelling to Srilanka. I am requesting Emirates hierarchies to review this and treat every passenger the same. Honestly I thought I was travelling with EASYJET when I travelled from Srilanka to Dubai."
5,October 2022,Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai,Family Leisure,B Carter,28th October 2022,7,A380,5,5,3,3,4,Economy Class,4,na,Trip Verified,good value and great staff,"Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai. The service on board was great. The touchscreen of the board entertainment system is on some planes are better than on others. The movie collection was vast but didn't fit my taste. My seat wasn't locked. So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern. They count the overweight as total. If family members check in individually, they could save a few bucks."
6,October 2022,Dubai to Venice,Solo Leisure,D Layne,26th October 2022,9,?,5,5,5,5,5,Economy Class,4,na,Trip Verified,A good flight, EK135 22 October Seat 46A. This flight was a continuation of the Brisbane to Dubai flight 24 hours later. The flight was not full but paid and was given twin seats for myself and wife. Worth the extra cost as 3 rows of seats behind reserved for cabin crew who never used them on this flight. Took off on time arrived on time 2 meals served on flight and usual water and soft drinks tea and coffee. A good flight.
7,October 2022,Brisbane to Dubai,Couple Leisure,P Lane,25th October 2022,9,A380,4,5,5,5,5,Economy Class,4,na,Trip Verified,Gluten Free meals are excellent, Brisbane to Dubai. Paid for seat selection and was given correct seat aisle 84c was fortunate there was empty middle seat on 14 hour flight. The Gluten Free meals which Emirates serve are excellent. The flight went smoothly and landed safely. Perhaps the only negative was water given with 2 meals and snack no cabin crew coming around with extra water between you seem to have to ask. Then stayed overnight at Dubai Airport Hotel before onward journey to Venice.
8,October 2022,Copenhagen to Sydney via Dubai,Solo Leisure,Robyn Annabel,21st October 2022,1,Boeing 777 / A380,1,1,1,1,2,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,hasn't been a great experience," The service I expected from a low cost carrier, not one of the supposedly best airlines in the world. One of the check in ladies at Copenhagen refused to let me carry on my carry on baggage, despite having taken 12 other flights, including 2 other Emirates flights with no problems on this trip. I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead. All in all, for an airline that I was so excited to fly with, it hasn't been a great experience and I will be looking at other airlines before flying Emirates again that's for sure."
9,October 2022,Bali to London via Dubia,Solo Leisure,A Smith,18th October 2022,6,Boeing 777- 300 / A380- 800,3,4,4,4,3,Economy Class,2,na,Trip Verified,think I would try another airline," A very cramped journey from Bali to Dubai in economy with barely any space to put my feet and I am only 5 ft 2. The pilot was very communicative about passing tropical weather and the air hostess were lovely. With just a 1 hour transit in Dubai I hopped onto the A380 which is much bigger but the walkways are still soo mall. The air hostess on this flight were not as friendly. A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didn’t serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didn’t exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasn’t impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines. The air hostess were OK about re filling my water bottle. All in all I think I would try another airline for this long journey next time, just a few bad vibes from the staff with regards to meals and sleeping as mentioned above."

Even in economy the seats are decently sized for a nap and staff are always ready to help."
11,October 2022,Kochi to Dubai,Solo Leisure,N Lakshmi,10th October 2022,4,na,4,4,1,3,3,Economy Class,1,na,Not Verified,experience was not something great," Right from the airport I was facing an unpleasant experience. I was having a laptop bag and one hand baggage. The hand baggage was weighing exactly 7kg but he forced me to put both together and then put my baggage (there was no lock for it) into checked-in and had to pay for additional baggage. Then, while paying for it, they took my card and entered the card number when the payment is already done and machine has already generated receipt. Seems suspicious that my card number is needed to generate a receipt to my email for the additional baggage? Now money is gone and the baggage is damaged. The flight experience was not something great. Landing in Dubai had to wait forever for my baggage."

Will avoid in further booking."
13,October 2022,Bangkok to Johannesburg via Dubai,Couple Leisure,P Ison,4th October 2022,1,na,1,na,3,na,3,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,worst booking experience,"Bangkok to Johannesburg via Dubai. This must have been the worst booking experience and customer service of my life. My partner and I booked the exact same route at the exact same time from 2 different laptops directly from the Emirates website. Emirates confirmed they received his payment, the money was out of his account, but part of his flight is not yet confirmed. After a couple of attempts, they made some adjustments and sorted out the issue a few hours later. My booking could not process payment due to a pricing problem between the airlines. After numerous failed attempts over 3 days via customer service and live chats, failed rebooking attempts for the same route, and empty promises from customer agents calling me back, I finally just booked another date to ensure that we can at least spend Christmas together. NEVER in my life have I experienced any issues like this with Qatar (or any other airlines for that matter). Emirates advertise routes and when it comes to booking, they're not able to process and if they do process, they do a half-ass job which leaves customers feeling stressed and running around trying to finalize flight details. Avoid avoid avoid is all I can say. There is a reason Qatar airways is 5 star, and Emirates is 4 star."
14,September 2022,Dubai to Algiers,Family Leisure,Hassiba Benamara,26th September 2022,3,na,1,1,1,3,3,Economy Class,2,1,Trip Verified,Very impolite and rude cabin crew, Very impolite and rude cabin crew from ticketing counter to inside the plane. No just they don’t want help but also ignore you. And you try to catch the attention they literally yell and pass sarcastic comments. I was traveling with my 1 year old. They made our flight a horrible experience and on purpose they did not offer baby food in a 7 hour flight. All crew looked unhappy and were unpleasant to talk with mostly female crews. My flight from Dubai to Algeria was a nightmare because of crew negative behavior and lack of empathy for a mother who’s was traveling with a 1 year old.
15,August 2022,Glasgow to Dubai,Couple Leisure,Russell Taylor,24th September 2022,1,Boeing 777-300,1,1,3,1,2,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,attendants should have stopped serving this pair, It wasn’t a good experience at all. Young newly married couple who were clearly already pretty tipsy on boarding starting boozing hard as soon as it took off and kept a steady pace of drinking solidly for the entire 8hr flight. Cabin attendants kept giving them can after can even though they were getting very drunk. No consideration for others seated anywhere near them and it was really quite uncomfortable given the volume of their constant loud drunken chatter. After we landed at Dubai as I was standing in the aisle waiting on someone lifting something down from the overhead bins the male passenger staggered to his feet wobbled towards me and aggressively barked “where do you think you’re going eh?” Thankfully he was drunk enough I could sidestep him and leave him swaying around but come on Emirates you’re better than this. The cabin attendants should have stopped serving this pair long before landing as they were clearly intoxicated. Not good at all.
16,September 2022,Singapore to London via Dubai,Business,Martin Hodges-Jones,22nd September 2022,1,A380,1,1,1,1,1,Business Class,1,1,Not Verified,Please pick another airline," The first time travelling Emirates Business class and the last. They lost my luggage in Dubai and have now been without it for nearly 3 weeks. They have not contacted me once. I have phoned 3 times and have been promised $50 per day compensation, money back for all the clothes I have had to buy and calls back to advise on the progress of tracing my lost luggage. When I ask about how I claim this compensation they refuse to answer. They also refuse to answer timelines for tracing my luggage. They have been utterly useless and disinterested. I have called them, used Twitter and Facebook and they have delivered only generic responses. I have lodged two complaints through their complaints portal. No response. Please pick another airline."
17,September 2022,Athens to Perth via Dubai,Couple Leisure,A Henneberry,20th September 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,Absolutely terrible experience," Firstly, canceled flights departing Athens to Perth leaving us stranded in Athens for a night so we had to get accomodation. Then you had my booked with a 14 hour stop over in Dubai which is unacceptable. I requested this to be changed and it was to a later flight which worked better. I was reassured my partners flight had been linked (we had separate bookings) and that we were both on the new flight together (this was via virtual chat). We arrive at the airport to check in and even though he had received flight confirmation we were told he didn’t have tickets so we had to go get this sorted at the emirates desk. We’re both finally on the same flight only to be told we cannot be seated together on either of the flights even though we booked months ago and had already selected our seats together. The man at Athens airport checking us in did not care or try to assist us. Absolutely terrible experience and now my partner and I get to sit alone on an 11 hour flight. Completely unacceptable and very poor form from Emirates. I want a refund or some form of compensation for the hotel, meals in Athens whilst stranded and the stress of this whole situation. Completely ruined the end of our trip. I will never fly with them again."
18,September 2022,Bangkok to London Gatwick via Dubai,Family Leisure,Dua Mawrassi,20th September 2022,1,na,1,3,1,3,1,Economy Class,1,na,Not Verified,I simply wouldn’t trust them," We arrived in good time to check in at Dubai only to find that my wife’s and 5 year old daughters seats had been changed to be apart on the flight. Previously we had been sent an automatic allocation of seats 2 days before the flight placing them together. Despite my pointing out that a 5 year old cannot travel unaccompanied, no one seemed to care and I had to insist that a manager at least be involved. We were then taken to the aircraft in the hope that some passengers might change seats. 20 minutes past with no good news whilst we were just left to stand by the aircraft door. At no point was any offer made regarding accommodation or alternate flight and, again, we were encouraged to accept that our daughter would have to travel next to a random stranger and presumably feed herself hot meals throughout the 7 hour flight. And then as the doors were about to be shut 2 seats together were suddenly found! When I complained formally about the distress this all caused, a curt reply was sent denying that seats had been changed at check in. My view of this airline feels irreparable damaged and I simply wouldn’t trust them with providing a reliable and safe journey in the future when they cannot even look properly at what went wrong on this occasion."
19,August 2022,Bahrain to Birmingham via Dubai,Solo Leisure,E Lamari,14th September 2022,4,Boeing777-300er,2,2,2,3,3,Economy Class,4,2,Trip Verified,Emirates is overhyped for nothing," Outbound (BAH TO DXB): Smooth flight, generous amount of food for such a short flight and it was tasty as well Outbound (DXB to BHX): Disastrous, flight was overbooked and cramped making the staff take a long time to board, we economy passengers were basically treated like cattle. IFE wasn't responsive, and food especially breakfast were bad - portions fit for a child, and mid flight I realized the meals had given me stomach pains and nausea. Inbound (BHX to DXB): Extremely bad service, 3 hours after take off and nothing (not even drinks) were given, my blood sugar started going down and I got dizzy because of that. When meals were served finally, it seemed the attendants forgot to give a lot of people meals (including my seat mate). Besides that, my meal was terrible barely cooked pasta with a droplet of sauce, dead vegetables that was pathetically called a salad, and I was given a bread roll with nothing to use it with. Crew barely served any drinks, I got massively dehydrated (7hrs flight), and in the morning they refused to serve me breakfast because I woke up 2 hours before landing - not even a coffee or tea was offered to me. Overall, it's was a very below average flight and Emirates is overhyped for nothing."

Water was dripping from the roof and the crew took it very lightly. They were responding that we have informed to our manager, but no actions were taken about it till i landed in Amsterdam. I literally had to hold and sit with the plastic cover they had given as the blanket cover for most of the distance."
21,September 2022,Dallas to Ahmedabad via Dubai,Solo Leisure,F Shah,10th September 2022,2,na,na,na,1,na,na,Economy Class,3,na,Not Verified,disappointing and inconvenient," I had booked return flights with wheelchair service for my 60 year old Mom for AMD to DFW and back. The flight schedule was changed and instead of 3 hours bearable lay-over, now there was a 11 hour lay-over. They gave hotel accommodation but I was still worried due to my mother’s health and age.  While returning from DFW and reaching DXB, they told my mother that she doesn’t have wheelchair booked. Due to less passengers, upon asking for help, they agreed to provide her wheelchair but what if the flight was packed? Strike 3: I talked to customer service about their initial refusal to provide a wheelchair and they had no answer but “Her wheelchair is booked”. So I asked customer service for the instructions that my mother should follow to get back to the airport from hotel and again the only answer to all my questions was “Our staff will be there to assist her everywhere”. After her hotel stay, my mother was dropped at the road-side of the airport with nobody to help. She asked questions to the passing-by people and thank God she was able to find her way into the airport wheelchair counter. I genuinely liked Emirates but this is very disappointing and inconvenient especially given that mother is a senior citizen. I’ll never fly emirates again."

The booking was made and fully paid for four months ago. I have been advised by curt email that I have been downgraded to business class, no mention of apology, explanation nor compensation or refund. It gets better, there seems no way of contacting Emirates in New Zealand their advertised phone number is cut off. What a shambles of an airline and we haven't even left the ground. This is how they treat premium paying clients, forget it. Book with another airline, never again!"
23,September 2022,Dubai to London,Business,R Peale,5th September 2022,8,A380,5,5,5,5,3,Premium Economy,4,na,Trip Verified,Food and service excellent, My first experience of Emirates new premium economy class. Food and service excellent. Seats however are a little bit firm and not as comfortable as the pictures suggest. Also the recline is quite big so you can feel a little trapped once the person in front refines. Access to three toilets for 50 plus passengers is a real bonus and you get glimpses of the flight deck if that is an interest. I paid very little in cost difference which was the attraction but Emirates economy is very good in any case so May not always be a choice I am willing to pay much extra for. Also it was a two meal service for a seven hour flight which is good.

In Houston, she paid $225 for an extra suitcase. The agent asked for cash and said they do not accept credit card but after my sister insisting that she does not have cash, they accepted her credit card.  Upon her arrival to Dubai for her second leg of her flight, she was asked to pay over $300 again. When she showed her receipt and the destination noted, the agent started to scream at her and say, either she pays or she will lose her flight. When she tried to reason, the man started to scream more and louder, and took her passport. My sister told him that she will pay, just tell her how to do it. Then the agent took her to a counter and when she went to pay, the price was increased to $350. She paid with credit card and they wanted the pin to her credit card. She told them the she did not have the PIN as this was not debit.  She decided to pay in cash, so she can leave but the agent got on her face. She was handed a repeat for $285 and she did not get her change back out of $400.  Now, I am scrambling in Houston to find a return flight for her, so she does not have to return to Dubai and moreover, to travel with Emirate. "

Very disappointing."

I paid over £2,500 for tickets from London to Dubai to Bangladesh for early next year. I’m travelling with my wife and 2 babies (1 &2.5 years old). The only reason I chose their flights was because it gave the best option of 14 hours in total for flight and transit which is still long with 2 babies but better than 21.5 hours, they suddenly decided to change my original flights, booked only 10 days before, they’ve sent me a text and a short email to say: this is your new itinerary nothing else. I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract. But nothing and when we tried to call their number in London this guy said he can’t help us with rebooking or a refund but he can put us through to them in Dubai. I hang on and on for 3 hours before realising this was a trick to just get rid of us. I got tired and hung up. There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we can’t answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers. Not only are we devastated but also out of pocket by £2,500 because we can’t possibly go on their imposed alternative flight of 21.5 hours with 2 small restless babies. "

However, just a few weeks before our flight, Emirates, without giving us any options, just changed our flight date and a much longer transit time in Dubai, no offer for a hotel overnight stay. In ZH, they have no office, nor could we contact their phone no. It is a frustrating and a sad first time try with Emirates."

They forced me to check my carry-on, and then they lost it. Since then, they have not made any attempt to locate it beyond emailing the airport, even though I have called them daily, written to them on Facebook, and submitted multiple complaint forms (they have no answered the complaint forms). I every time I call them, they say ""Ma'am, we've emailed the airport and haven't heard back yet. Please be patient."" I've called the airport, and the representative I spoke with said that Emirates needs to show up in person to locate my missing suitcase - he said that just emailing the airport, as they've done, will accomplish nothing. When I relayed this info to Emirates, they refused to listen. Everyone I've spoken with tries to get off the phone as quickly as possible without taking steps to investigate the issue. It's incredibly frustrating to be stuck in this limbo with airline that will not solve a problem that is their responsibility to solve."

EK remains the best in Economy. I couldn't fault this flight at all. Check in was easy and friendly ground handling agents despite Dallas being chaotic due to the storms. Onboard the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The food was plentiful and the IFE was excellent. Wifi was slowish at times but suffice for WhatsApp and communication. I was dreading flying 15 hours in coach but EK made this experience a lot better!

Qantas blew Emirates out of the water. Worst business class ever. Really disappointed. You pay a lot to fly business class, so the expectation that something as simple as the food to be hot should be expected. Both flights the food was Luke warm. Can't stand cold food. It maybe the size of the A380 business class, but the whole set up seemed cold. Took off, and it was like a conveyor belt. Seat cushion on for sleep. Food orders taken. Place mat down. Crew were like robots, zero warmth. Qantas do the same, but just felt totally different. More customer interaction and dare I say warmth. 777 flight was a little better but the food was still cold. Sorry unacceptable in business class or even economy for that matter. Not looking forward to our flight from Europe back to Singapore in 6 weeks. When you save to fly business class, when the airline gets it wrong you feel ripped off. Yes they got us there in one piece with our luggage so I suppose I should be happy with that. We get to try Singapore Airlines and Turkish Air BC on this trip as well. So these flights on Emirates I dare say will be our last. Quite simply they don't live up to their reputation which is such a shame."

We flew from Lebanon to Dubai and then to Sydney our baggage was delayed so it was meant to arrive on the next flight. A week later with no information at all about our baggage which we had to chase up on a daily basis, the bags arrived damaged.

The first time I didn’t get my luggage on arrival and no compensation above all. An airlines who allows itself to plan short connection, and arrives late in Dubai, to the price of leaving your luggages behind. And after complaining to the customer service, this is what you get : “ Dear Miss Bacconnet, Thank you for your correspondence. I regret the inconvenience you experienced when your baggage was not available for collection upon you arrival in Paris on 30 May 2022. Our records indicate that your baggage was unintentionally left behind in Dubai and subsequently returned to you. Compensation for delayed baggage is offered to passengers to assist with the purchase of essential items of an immediate need. Passengers who are residents in the country where the claim has been registered are not eligible for this payment. Delayed baggage compensation also does not cover consequential expenses such as hotel accommodation, transportation, loss of income etc. We are not in a position to offer compensation and recommend that you contact your insurance company for assistance. Thank you for the opportunity to respond. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you on board in the near future under more favourable circumstances. Yours sincerely, Emirates Customer Affairs” Apparently, even though I don’t leave in Paris, I don’t have “essential needs” because my country can its residents all their essential needs. It is well known that when you live in a country, everything is free for you. Like I didn’t pay the hotel because I had to wait for my luggage for almost two hours after someone came to me to let me know it’s not gonna come today so that I missed my train back home. Consequently I had to book a night in a hostel because a hotel in Paris is crazy expansive. And as I didn’t have essentials I had to pay not less than 4€ to rent a ridiculous cheap quality towel. The service onboard is not exceptional, the crew is not really willing to help. The AC is crazy low and when you ask for second blanket, it looks like you ask too much. Compared to Qatar there is no free wifi allowance. "

Wen we arrived Dubai Airport then Emirates staff gave us Boarding passes and meal vouchers for another rebooking which was 6 hours later and I asked for lounge or some waiting areas from the staff since I carrying 1 month infant with me along 1 child, she denied saying that lounges are all occupied because all flights are delayed. I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible. I was not informed that there will be no announcements on this airport and she did not even tell that your gate may be in another building for which you will have to go by bus or metro which takes another 30-40 minutes at least. Somehow I found a place to feed my baby which was quite far but concourse B was mentioned on my Boarding pass so I thought its near only we went to relax n feed my baby and later our gate was changed to another building and I did not know it will take such long time to reach there. Running through the way we couldn't manage it to the gate, we missed that flight too. I believe Emirates staff should communicate with the passenger clearly about the important information specially when someone like me who is going on Dubai Airport first time. I could get direct flight from Bahrain to Delhi but I wanted my family to experience the service Of Emirates and they experienced the worst experience, partially because of bad weather Delays and partially because of staff's miscommunication or no interest to facilitate the passenger with special need or request.

Was put on EK2010 to JFK although I requested for next day EK213. Emirates lied by misinforming that none was available. Came to know later that those who shouted were accommodated. Unfortunate, but it works with Emirates Suffered a lot due to due to the forced itinerary. Lost additional 500 USD in hotel reservations and bus connections, Miami to Tampa.

Check in a bit tacky (but friendly) regarding visa and check-in system not running, but after 20 mins I finally got my boarding pass. On both flights I got an excellent meal with appetiser, main, cheese and desert on a tray and it was no problem to get some wine with it. A generous perk as Silver EK-member is I was permitted into the Emirates Business Lounge in Dubai, which is an excellent place for a shower, some really good food."

It canceled my original flight and change to new one with more than 8 hours gap, and they didn't suggest any facility. Also, the reason for canceling the first flight is unclear, because the first flight was working and no need to change my flight. Their behavior in check-in was very rude. They weight everything even a tiny kid backpack and charged very expensively for even 1 kilo overweight. Finally, I never use this unreliable airline."
39,July 2022,Cochin to Dubai,Business,Susan Thomas ,3rd August 2022,5,na,1,1,2,2,3,Business Class,3,3,Trip Verified,!I had a horrendous experience, We traveled from Cochin to Dubai on 31st July via Business class. I had a horrendous experience with the flight attendants. The supervisor and the assistant had completely forgotten all the etiquette and the hospitality they are supposed to extend. I feel Emirates must give refresher courses to the staff and continuous evaluation should be taken to maintain the standard. When I expressed my displeasure they were asking me what should I serve to make me happy and I told them we don't choose Emirates for food. I'm thoroughly disappointed with their attitude and behavior.

During a flight departing from Toronto to Dubai the flight crew allowed the children sitting behind me to use my seat as a climbing frame. With no regard for myself or the other passengers within the row nothing was addressed. Eating the served meal was impossible as was any attempt at drinking any fluids. This was drawn to the attention of both the parents and the flight staff all to no avail. If the children were not climbing then they were kicking the back of my seat. The children would seldom sit even during turbulence and during take-off and landing. After so many years of traveling with Emirates this whole encounter will cause me to look at alternate airlines.

This last time check-in took a bit too much than I would expect for Business, but security fast-track works well and is convenient. In Lisbon Emirates uses the TAP lounge which is a bummer as other than being very crowded at all times, it is located before passport control (Schengen area) which forces people to leave much earlier than boarding start. If flying Business in the Boeing 777-300 do choose the front mini-cabin (first 2 rows before the door) as all the 300+ Economy passengers board through the door before the aft cabin leading to an annoying 1h boarding process with people passing by. Food and crew are usually great and very helpful and friendly. At Dubai very easy process to go through priority passport control and to reach the complimentary limo service, all very efficient. I have found some drivers to be quite rude and/or driving dangerously - Emirates should improve their standards for this personnel. All in all, Emirates is one of the few airlines offering a truly distinctive premium service, from the moment you leave home until you set your feet at your destination hotel. I will continue flying with them."

We found a suitable flight with Emirates although it was about triple what I normally pay for a planned flight home. At Birmingham the checkin staff were not very helpful and then the flight to Amsterdam was delayed but I was told not to worry, I would still get my onwards flight from Schipol to Nairobi. However, when I arrived at Amsterdam my flight had departed. I was offered a flight 24 hours later but turned it down as I would miss my brother’s funeral and I would be devastated. I was offered and accepted an alternative flight via Entebbe, Uganda, which I accepted. However, when I arrived at Entebbe I was refused boarding on the flight to Nairobi - Emirates had messed up. I had no money for an alternative flight and no roaming on my phone so I Whattsapp’d my husband in UK and he phoned up Emirates Dubai office at great expense and after half an hour convinced the call handler to book me onto a later flight to Nairobi. I missed my brother’s funeral and I will never forgive Emirates for their incompetence and lack of care. I’ve complained to Emirates and they denied all responsibility blaming factors outside of their control but I don’t believe them. They have offered me some free Air Miles but I will never fly with Emirates again! "

I travelled with my 2 daughters of 2 and 7 years. I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic. I need to think million one times to make another booking with Emirates. Families travelling with kids are not recommended to choose this airline. More dissatisfaction occurred when reporting the above mentioned incidents to the customer support. Hardly any apologies to little reassurance from them too. Overall my travel experience with Emirates was pathetic."
44,May 2022,Bergen to Dubai via Oslo,Business,R Connolly,26th July 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful," Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line. Bags were checked all the way through to Dubai, where we would then have a rest and get a flight to Melbourne the following day. Attempted to board and told our tickets had been cancelled - by us! Somehow in the air from Bergen, we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai - seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go, who to contact, how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets - for being a “no show” which is 100% wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel, footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty / half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service (or lack of customer service!). After a terrible flight home, straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to re-schedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write, email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne, we have had zero response! The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers - it’s all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less. Oh - actually they did offer us a special treat from business class, how could I forget they asked if we wanted a cappuccino from a machine. I don’t drink coffee."

My check-in luggage is missing, despite I confirmed with the check-in counter in Dubrovnik multiple times that my luggage will be delivered automatically to Japan without any manual transfer procedure required in Dubai. The WIFI (cost 19.9 usd) I bought onboard doesn't work most of the time. When I went to the toilet shortly before landing, the attendant reluctantly open the door for me. But he kept pushing by saying ""do it really quick"" and even knocked the door irritatedly. He didn't apologise even after I asked him to use proper English and better manner. The company changed the aircraft without notice. I book the aisle seat but it ended up as a window seat. (Another attendant helped me change the seat. That is the only positive experience onboard.)

If you have kids avoid this airline as much as possible. We had two hours of delay on first flight and they did not keep the next flight for 5 minutes for us to catch it, although the tickets were bought connected. They book us on a flight with 14 hours difference the problem was we arrived vey late at night and all shops were closed and they compensated with one night hotel and nothing else. They also has absolutely no priority for kids not in boarding and not for caring a small kid has special need like diapers you can not just easily book them in next day flight at midnight. With all these problems they put on us, they also did not want to let us take our yoyo stroller on board, we had to fight them and without stroller at midnight in a closed airport when they book us on next day flight I do not know what we should do. Terrible is even a good word to describe Emirates. "

Even if upgrading my ticket to Flex would have solved the weight limit for a cheaper price the staff refused to make any change. Also, despite the emergency seat being partially free I was not allowed to take one because I haven't paid extra fees upfront for this option. I heard good things about this company, yet as my first experience turned out to be a nightmare I’ll stay far away from this one in the future. I hope ANA will soon resume operating their own flight to France soon."

After boarding, there were at least 3 empty seats at the emergency exit in economy class, I asked the crew if I could change my seat to one the emergency exit empty seat. The reply was you need to pay $200 extra for that. I explained why I need to move to a seat with more leg space and that it’s still an economy seat that no one is using, they simply said sorry we can’t. The whole flight I was shivering and when I asked for an extra blanket the reply was sorry everyone is asking for extra blanket. I has a much better experience with other airlines.

I doubt they are any better than a 2-star service. Their airport staffs are either rude or cold. Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies. They send me round in circles on 2 different trips, and the issue still remains unresolved after a week. As a gold member, I get a pleasant smile and a warm welcome, but that is just faking a few words that have no value whatsoever. Anytime I requested any help, I more or less got nothing for being Gold. The only thing that remains for being Gold is Fast Check-in in the Dubai airport and a few other airports outside the UAE, Lounge access, and sometimes faster delivery of your check-in baggage. There was a time Emirates was better or as good as Qatar Airways. Overall, EK's poor customer service let it down big time. As a customer, my last 2 experiences have been terrible."

59,April 2022,Dubai to Algiers,Business,Mohamed Boutrid,9th June 2022,4,Boeing 777,4,1,2,1,1,Business Class,1,1,Trip Verified,the worst business class experience," At Algiers airport, the lounge is lifeless.  In the plane, the power receptacle is broken on my seat but luckily no one was sitting next to me to use his. The live TV did not work and the images are distorted. The live TV displays a few frames then freezes for a minute or so before displaying more frames. I was trying to watch the football game between ManU and Chelsea. The food (we were fasting) they left by your seat and then it took another 15 minutes to bring nuts and drinks after Maghrib. I just wanted soup for Iftar. In addition, when I was asked to choose my entree, it was not available. The seat I had 11A was very noisy. Usually they distribute pouches with socks, toothbrush and toothpaste and a blind mask in addition to ear plugs which would have been helpful. After all this is business class. The only bright thing in this upgrade is that the hostesses were brilliant and even tolerated my displeasure with these inconveniences in a nice way. In any case, this is the worst business class experience flying Emirates ever. Most likely it will be my last at least on this route. This is their reply: Dear Mr Boutrid, Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2022 regarding Emirates flight EK 758 from Algiers to Dubai on 28 April. I am concerned to learn of your disappointment with the lounge at Algiers airport. This lounge is operated by a service provider. Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew. I regret that you did not enjoy our product offering as much as we would have liked."
60,June 2022,Dubai to Delhi,Family Leisure,Richa Khare,7th June 2022,2,na,4,5,1,4,3,Economy Class,3,4,Trip Verified,antagonistic experience in both journeys," It was a round trip with Emirates from Delhi to Dubai and antagonistic experience in both journeys. Ground staff at Dubai was very rude and unhelpful whereas in India the check in was way easier despite of huge rush. We were stuck and struggling for self check in (which we were guided again and again by the limited staff available) and finally after half an hour when our check in baggage got stuck on the belt and we again have to helplessly ask for help for which the lady at the counter replied us to wait for 2-3 minutes. After 10 minutes when nobody turned up my husband reminded the same lady at the counter that we need help to which she replied I am on some other report and we should proceed towards manual counter. We were shocked! My husband reminded her that our baggage is stuck to which she responded with irritation and called some technical staff to provide our baggage. Then we proceeded towards manual counter where again with technical glitches our check in was done in half an hour when all our documents were properly in place. In short more than an hour to check in at Dubai airport with Emirates without rush whereas in India within an hour we were done with check in, security and immigration! My suggestion to the passengers travelling from Emirates please don't expect soft spoken and helpful staff specially at Dubai airport and have spare time in hand to bear with the glitches."

No Priority boarding, No pre fight drinks offered, no enhanced meal service, no separation of section resulting in long queues for the bathroom from others in Economy. On arrival into UK no priority baggage collection. As a frequent traveller of this service with other airlines the offerings from Emirates fall severely short. Its a shame as the seat was comfortable and if all the missing elements were there would convert me to continue to use Emirates airlines for all my travelling requirements. I hope that these offerings will be addressed in the very near future as I felt a little cheated by paying for the upgrade with no real enhancement of service apart from a seat!"

Flight attendants do not provide any service at all. Their info online contradicts what employees in airport are implementing. Headphones have an old plug so nothing fits but cheapest given. No human approach, no compassion, no apologies. Just everyone feels you owe them not the opposite. Bumped me with the child to next day regardless of the info online, them stick me in the last row seat since I ""gave them trouble"", plus I did not have any time to purchase new seats for the next flight. Connection was 5 hrs when tickets were initially purchased, at the flight time became 17 hrs layover. Cheapest in everything. "

I found a solid product and comfort on board but service from the staff was just OK. There is a lack of personal touch throughout the whole flight experience from check-in procedure that was very cold both ways to the inflight mode. I always felt like an economy class pax on the ground both at check-in and in the lounge both in Italy & USA. Far different from what you feel flying QR in business for instance. Return flight on A6-EEA was disappointing because the aircraft was showing his age: my suite was completely worn out, sliding doors broken. EK should pay attention to this details and make sure everything is renewed especially in premium cabins where there is too much difference between aircraft to aircraft for A380's in their fleet. The food was very good quality in both legs. JFK-MXP flight was below average because of the service that was either too slow for the main meal or too rushed during breakfast. Shower SPA: both ways good experience the bathroom is huge with plenty of amenities and this is the real plus rather than the shower itself. Overall I think business class is the only product that worth the premium price for EK."
65,March 2022,Kolkata to Newark via Dubai,Couple Leisure,P Karsham,4th June 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,getting worse day by day," Emirates services are getting worse day by day, I had my flight from Dubai to New York where i had my connecting flight for Nassau, which they changed the time and destination to Newark. The bag drop counter was closed, so I had to take all my luggage to the counter of JetBlue to checkin. When I reached Jet blue the attendants were not helpful at all said the counter is closed and my flight departure times has been changed from 7am to 10am. And they are unable to take my luggage and won't provide any accommodations that I should take my complaints to emirates counter. Emirates ground staff refused to help said I should contact customer service. As I did not have a USA number I had to use my roaming services to call Emirates customer service, after 45 mins being on call i was told that they cannot help and I need to contact ground staff of Emirates. When I went back to Emirates ground staff they said they can't do anything as it was their closing time. Not to mention my flight from Ewr to Nassau also kept getting delayed. I was stranded at the airport as I was not able to arrange a hotel because by the time I could finish all this run around and phone calls it was almost midnight. The only option to eat was dunkin donuts. Worst part was both Jetblue which was affiliated with Emirates and staff of Emirates did not showed any regrets. They cared less if I was being helped or directed. I bought my ticket from the website of Emirates and this was my worst experience ever. I will always avoid flying with this airline."

I travelled for a family death with only a carryon from Lax on Tues, 24th May, no problems. At Cochin on my way back on Sun, 29th May, they wouldn’t allow my carryon citing allowance limit. Didn’t have a second bag and had to carry my laptop and electronics in a duty free bag to LAX. Happy to comply with rules, but they can’t and shouldn’t be discriminatory. LAX and COK can’t have different rules for the same tickets and airlines. Many passengers in economy from COK were in violation of the number of carryons and weight limit as stated on the tickets. This was my first Emirates flight in many years and kind of reminded me why I prefer Qatar Airways / Singapore Airlines."

Reached airport 3 hours before and followed all proceedure till reaching the flight, also the seat was booked myself and paid extra for that. Nevertheless when I reached at flight EK007 my mom seat was under repair and technician was still working on it to fix due to seat mechanism was not working and again i had to wait for another 10 minutes in the flight but still it was not fixed and moving front and back without button. I  had to survive 7 hours with it. Informed flight attendant but only one apology, was not enough instead of upgrading or finding another seat. My experience was not at all good."

Great service from the cabin crew, who were attentive, but also had a great sense of humour and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the flight. A light breakfast was served after departure from Dubai, with fresh fruits and breads. Lunch served about 2 hours before arrival into LHR. My wife and I chose the Fish tahta as a main course. This was roasted Kingfish in spicy rice, really tasty and generous portion. The Emirates Bar is a great feature on the A380 and we enjoyed a cocktail and a laugh and joke with the cabin crew. This really adds to the travel experience and is one of the features which makes travelling with Emirates a pleasant experience."

Fast track security is offered for travellers in Business and First Class. Emirates use the Air Mauritius Les Salons Amedee Maingard lounge, which is ok but not the standard of a typical Emirates Lounge. Flight boarded and departed on time. As this is an overnight flight Emirates serve a dinner service soon after take-off. I had the Chicken Biryani, which was OK. Unfortunately for my wife, who was being served from the other aisle, their system failed and they forgot to serve my wife’s main course. Although very apologetic by the time they realised their mistake it was already getting late so my wife went without and just had the desert! Not ideal. Otherwise the flight was OK and landed on time into Dubai."

Took flight from JFK New York, with an hour delay, which caused missing my connecting flight which had 1:20 layover at Dubai but ended up with the next flight with 6 hrs hours wait at Dubai. Emirates had given us 'Food voucher' which could buy you a soup and water for 6 hrs wait at Dubai airport. Finally got on the next flight, not so impressive food but nice crew service though."

Other reasons, I was assigned different seat at JFK while I had pre-booked another one. Food wasn't impressive, Qatar Airways had better food a few weeks earlier on the same route, Crew was great. Full disclosure, at DXB a staff members waited near plane exit to direct passengers, handing new Boarding Pass and food vouchers. I'm still waiting for the next flight, and haven't checked airport voucher food yet (hope it won't restrict me to a Big Mac or some)."

Emirates did not even provide food or hotel or even gave clear time when we will be traveling back to Sydney (Original Destination). Emirates service used to be a lot better. Will never ever use Emirates. I guess Emirates reach to a point that they do not care about their passengers.

Even though the flight was at 02-35 the Business Class lounge at the A gates was quite busy with limited seating. The bonus was boarding direct from the lounge. My seat was 14E was quite comfortable and the cabin crew offered supplementary mattresses. Passed on the initial meal service on this overnight flight. Breakfast was served prior to landing in Mauritius. Fruits were nice, I then tried the omelette, which was not brilliant. Flight landed on time and bags delivered promptly."

Check in at LGW was quick and efficient. Made our way to the Emirates lounge as we had a couple of hours to spare. Service was good in the lounge and after about 15 minutes they served a hot lunch. The Goan Chicken Curry was pleasant. Flight boarded and departed on time. My wife and I had seats 14E and 14F which are ideal for a couple travelling together. At the time of travel masks were mandatory, Emirates provided spare masks and sanitizer. The food service on Emirates used to be quite drawn out but with the new system they take the meal selection from the passengers on a hand held device and it seems to be delivered in quite an efficient manner. I chose the Arabic Mezze, which was very tasty followed by the Beef Tenderloin, which was also good. Good choice of wine available. Emirates only serve one meal on the flight from Gatwick to Dubai, which we found to be sufficient. Snacks and sandwiches are available at any time, either delivered to your seat or from the bar. Overall a very good flight with Emirates."

I had to cancel my flight due to illness only 2 weeks before departure and phoned the Lisbon office. After pressing 2 buttons I was talking to a rep after less than 2 minutes. Much to my surprise, for a base ticket, he said I was entitled to a refund and sent me a refund form. Nothing arrived for a month so I again phoned and the mistake I had made in completing the refund form was explained and another sent. After only 2 weeks a partial refund for 'no show' was credited to my account and when I queried why 'no show' for a cancellation I received an apologetic mail confirming full refund which duly arrived after only 10 days. This compares with Ryanair who will fight tooth and nail to avoid any, even legitimate, refund. Guess where my loyalties will lie in future - Emirates!"
76,April 2022,Dubai to Brisbane,Business,Roger Stone,23rd May 2022,8,A380,4,5,4,3,5,Business Class,4,4,Trip Verified,superb food and wine," A business trip from Sydney to Zurich and then back to Brisbane, code share with Qantas. Things that impressed me included the superb food and wine on all sectors (incl a nice printed menu and wine list), the wonderful Emirates First Class Lounges in Dubai (especially their prime lounge), the speedy and efficient boarding and the good cabin crews. Not so good was trying to get to a toilet in the middle of the night and having to make my way past lots of drunken passengers filling the bar area at the back of the A380 - which is also the area where the toilets are. I suggest this Lounge area could be made a barista coffee lounge instead (as much as I like a glass of wine). All flights pretty much on time. Compared with a recent Singapore Airlines business flight, Emirates were ahead in the food and wine area."

But I have to say that in all the years I have been flying business, the CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace. From the chaotic boarding in Paris when all first and business class passengers were held at the gate for 25 minutes (apparently for no reasons except that some sort of VIP showed up at some point and cut the line), without so much as an announcement from the person in charge. Once everyone was on board, the first announcement from the captain was about an hour delay in getting a takeoff slot. As we pushed back, their APU went out, no lights and aircon and back to the gate. Then some very vague information from the flight deck on some repairs being done, and another slot waiting time. Anyway the whole deal lasted 3 hours. Ok, that is a technical problem, it happens and that is the way it is. What bothered me during the whole time was the complete disdain of the cabin crew for the passengers. As a matter of facts, most of them seemed to enjoy the delay and were having some very long and loud conversations with some apparent friends in the aisles. The flight finally took off. And this is when the cabin crew showed its complete inability to handle the most basic service. Absolutely no care for the passengers, and except for some meal served in a hurry (during which I actually had to beg for a glass of wine previously ordered ) we only got to see them once in a while during the whole 7,5 hours. I want to think that this was a bad timing, or else. On the other end, the second leg of the flight from DXB to Moscow was excellent, and I actually found out how much was missing on the first leg then: Friendly and helpful cabin crew, good service. After all this is what we ask for in a flight! My rating will be below at 5/10. Zero for first leg, 10 for second leg."

Couple days ago (May 5), I went to Tehran Int. Airport (IKA) to travel to U.S.A. When I arrived at the Emirate ticketing counter in order to obtain my boarding pass, I experienced a bad situation which I have never had with any other airlines. The ticketing lady had a very bad attitude told me to show her my Covid test result which I did, then asking for Vaccination card that I responded that I am USA citizen and there is no need to have this card, which she started talking loud and being so rude, finally I found my card and passed it to her. After that I was glad that the issue was resolved and now she would process my luggage. I was wrong. She laid back at her chair and doing nothing. Finally I said to her this checking takes long time, please process my luggage. At the end I went to her team leader and explained her behavior. I am sure that the leader would not do anything to correct his group attitudes, because all of them are the same and they do not know any better, but I am sure that Emirates will lose more customers as times pass. From now on, I will broadcast and pass this bad experience to my friends and relatives and telling them not to fly with Emirates."

KHI-DXB, check in was friendly, flight was on time, clean plane, food was outstanding for a flight not even 2 hours long, crew was very friendly and attentive. Blankets and extra pillow were given. Landed in Dubai, went to the Dubai connect desk as it says on their website that if you have more than 10 hours layover, Emirates will provide you accommodation, at the desk, the guy was rude and straight up said Karachi office should have booked you earlier (Karachi office is the one that told me to contact Emirates at Dubai as they have no authority to book anything with Dubai Connect) and I was also told that even a prior booking was made, it would have been cancelled because accommodation is only available for passengers who bought tickets worth more than $1000 USD. Then I went back to the connection desk, explained the whole situation all over again, guy at the desk started blaming me that I am the one who chose to have a longer layover so it's not Emirates problem, he kept ignoring that key information that ""Emirates is the one who cancelled the flight from KHI to DXB, not me"". I have to admit, I became a Karen when he told me Emirates can't offer you anything, no compensation no food, nothing for a 15 hours layover. I refused to listen to him any further and demanded to see a manager right away, he ran back and got the manager at the desk, manager was extremely polite and apologetic, instructed to hand me over 2 meal vouchers immediately (previously I was told Emirates do not have any meal voucher offers etc, so that was the lie). So guys, if you want to be treated fairly by Emirates, you gotta fight hard. DXB to CDG, flight was on-time, full. Crew was very attentive, plane was spotless, food was disgusting. They served feta cheese sandwiches, they were absolutely inedible and were freezing cold as well that it hurts you teeth. Then the lights were switch off so it was good sleep with enough legroom. Breakfast was served an hour before landing and main hot breakfast was inedible as well, fruit portion was fresh but the bread roll was so cold that I couldn't slice or bite it (should learn from Turkish, they serve soft warm rolls). I have also noticed many people didn't eat the hot portion of the breakfast. I have to give a shout-out to one particular crew member, she handled the situation very well when she was yelled at by a grumpy middle age man when she asked him, if he would like to have a breakfast, he started yelling at her that ""no, I'm sleeping, can you see, stop yelling into my ears"". Honestly I wanted to intervene but there was no need to as she handled it quite well but I can tell, he kinda ruined her day."

The 777 has a strange business class configuration of 2x3x2. Who wants to be the unlucky fellow to sit in the middle of the 3, paying premium price? The service is OK but not great either. Food was as bland as ever, the seat is really narrow and uncomfortable. OK for a short to medium haul flight up to about 6 hours, anything longer than that would be an ordeal. Still, one redeeming grace is that, they sell this short leg at a very attractive price, so that is acceptable."

I have booked this trip in Jan, already paid for a domestic flight from Paris to Lyon that departs from Paris at noon on a same day I land there. Called Emirates, explained them the whole situation, even sent them a receipt of 100 euro plane (non-refundable) ticket I have already bought from Paris to Lyon, all they said, sorry, but that's not our problem if you gonna miss your connecting flight to Lyon. I kept on insisting that I must take the original schedule flight from DXB to CDG as planned so they must fix it. After a long argument, I am good to fly but with 15 hours layover at Dubai. I asked them for an accommodation through Dubai connect program, they refused to book anything or even provide a meal voucher (like Qatar Airways) reasoning that I am the one choosing to not to fly to Paris on immediate available connection, therefore, no accommodation or food for you. Their telephone rep people are so rude (not the Karachi one, Dubai helpline), literally telling me they don't care if I'm going to miss my connecting flight and that's not Emirates headache. Will provide an update on this journey once I will land in Paris. Stay tuned."

They are extremely unreliable and will cancel your flight at last minute. We flew from Chicago to Dubai to Amman and they ended up canceling our flight from Dubai to Amman. They rescheduled us for the next flight with a 18 hour layover with a 2 year old. We ended up needing to push our flight one day which made us lose precious time with our family that we haven’t seen in 3 years. Then our flight home from Amman to Dubai to Chicago, ended up being canceled again and now we are trying to change it because I have my sisters wedding the next day. I may be forced to miss it because of emirates irresponsibility to keep flights as they are when you book. Also, the food is horrendous and give no vegetarian options, I had to survive off the snacks I bought before hand and what the flight attendants gave me. I had to wait on hold for 2 hours to speak to someone for a cancellation they made. Save yourself the headache and avoid Emirates . I wish I did. You have lost a customer for life. Never flying with them again."

It was my first Emirates experience in 3 years, and as far as I was concerned nothing had changed, apart from the boarding procedure in Dubai which was nothing short of shambolic - but that is the airport, not the airline. As a direct result of the ineptitude of the gate staff we pushed back 1 hour 20 mins late. No matter. The service was friendly and efficient - nothing was too much trouble - and the food and drink really good. One doesn’t often have memorable meals on board any aircraft (preparation of same must be trying in the extreme), but the lunch served was top notch. A bonus in business class on board an A380 is the on board bar area, once again, service was excellent. I had a thoroughly enjoyable experience and look forward to my next Emirates experience."

They claim I was informed at check-in that I wasn’t eligible for the seat (lie) not informed at check-in. I had informed the cabin attendant my seat was wrong and that I paid extra money for my seat (and showed her my printed paperwork). They weren’t concerned. I looked at my original seat and someone else was seating in my seat. They charge me for a seat I didn’t get, then RE-SOLD my seat to someone else.

The gate lounge was jammed full with no space to sit or stand. A small boy vomited on the floor in the gate area. I informed an Emirates ground agent to call a cleaner and was given a blank stare. Passengers walked through the vomit and no clean-up was done. Boarding was unorganized with no sense of order. The aircraft pushed back approximately two hours after departure time. An announcement was made by a pilot stating the delay was due to 'baggage handling technical problems.' The digital menu was not working. I asked a cabin crew what was on the menu, and they stated to ask another crew member. Toilets were not clean and were smelly. I requested a drink in the galley from a cabin crew and he pointed to cups and a bottle of water and said 'get it yourself.' Cabin temperature was freezing cold. The seat was comfortable. Baggage arrived on two separate baggage carousels in SYD. This made baggage collection complicated and confusing. Overall, a comfortable flight but nothing special. I have had better on-time performance, service, and cabin cleanliness from low cost carriers."

The previous high quality service, little touches that made you feel a valued customer and friendly attendants onboard are all gone, vanished. Instead they've replaced this with grumpy attendants who don't pay attention to the customer, little things like noticing a low drink and filling it up before you have to ask, welcoming returning loyal customers - these are the things you pay for with Emirates and in Business class, now it might as well be a long Ryanair flight. They have lost all the caring aspects that gave them an edge, if you are going to fly to the middle east then use Qatar or even Turkish. Their seats are still comfy as anything, I'll give them that."

I called Emirates and they said I would be unable to fly back but that they could keep my ticket and place it on hold. When I went to change the date to fly back, they made me pay the fare difference. In this case, the cheapest fare difference I could get within a two week period was $400. How an airline can you charge you for getting covid is insane. I’m so disappointed and upset. Their customer service team on the phone was awful. I will never fly with Emirates again after this experience. I didn’t ask for covid, and got financial punished for it."
92,April 2022,Riyadh to Dubai via Seattle,Couple Leisure,S Pearce,3rd April 2022,1,Boeing 777-300,1,1,1,1,2,Premium Economy,1,1,Trip Verified,the problem was the airline treating their customers like cattle,"First Emirates flight ever. Food was served on a tray mis sized to the seat tray so difficult to keep in place. Food was hot but otherwise tasteless. Food for special orders is served 15 to 30 minutes before beverage cart comes by so only water on tray available to consumer. I paid extra for better seats but given the service and noise environment, it probably was a waste. Cabin is drafty, video headsets do not fit anyone, noise during my flights (esp. to SEA) was excessive. Airline does not address selected and/or comfortable seating for passengers with infants. Four infants on my flight were training talk show hosts as their lungs and screams lasted the entire 15 hour flight to SEA. The plane was full and staff gave little concern for passengers. On arrival in SEA the airline took forever (1.5 hours) to get luggage to customer even though I had a first class luggage tag on my one bag. Onward booking by airline had incorrect boarding info for ongoing flight and barely made the connection. Cannot imagine what others waited and how many missed connections. Yes, SEA is an airport to avoid for customs and general connection flights. But airline is responsible for getting luggage unloaded and Emirates failed customers but staff luggage was first off and first picked up. I will never fly Emirates ever. The problems were not a full plane or infants, the problem was the airline treating their customers like cattle and not taking action to address an unrestful environment."

My flight from NY to Dubai was delayed. After arriving late to Dubai for my connection flight to Male, I was informed by Emirates staff to go to luggage claims to get my luggage for my next emirates flight to Male. My luggage never came through after 40 mins. I informed an Emirates employee and they claimed that my luggage was already loaded onto my next flight. Upon going through customs, I missed my flight, so I was stuck in Dubai. I was forced to wait in 3 different long lines for a total of 5 hrs, just to be told that because I was a no show, I had to pay a $1200 fee. I informed the Emirates representative of what happened and they became rude and walked away. After 5 hrs I was able to speak to someone who understood situation and got me a next morning flight for my destination of Male. Upon receiving my new flight I was stranded in the airport for 17hrs before my 2:30am flight. On my original flight I paid for a extra legroom seat, but on the rescheduled flight I was forced to sit in a standard seat that really hurt my legs. After taking the grueling flight to Male, my luggage never came. I reported the incident to Male airport staff and they started an investigation for my luggage. I finally was able to take a transfer to maldives, but without any clothes or luggage. This entire situation ruined my vacation because this was over the weekend. So I'm at a resort with no change of clothes, and no toiletries. Emirates airlines turned my dream vacation into a nightmare. I will never fly with Emirates again with the rude, disrespectful employees."

I was going and picking up the things my little daughter needed and I was very annoyed but they did not pay attention and when I got off the plane I was the last passenger to get off because I was waiting for them to take my luggage from the bottom of the plane and give it to me and my daughter. It was my last trip with this airline.

I was travelling for the first time with my newborn and with covid being stressful enough and all the paperwork required to travel, Emirates whipped up a whammy by not arranging for me transit visa even after I organised this a month in advance as directed by Emirates Dubai connect. Their incompetence gave me a hard time travelling with my baby who was very tired after a long flight and since we trusted Emirates notifications, we got to the airport desk to find out our visas were not organised and had to wait 2 hours in the airport for this. I could have easily paid for my visa weeks in advance and had a hassle free experience but even with repeated enquiries with Emirates customer service, I was told the visa was complimentary and not to worry about it. Truly horrifying experience and they never managed to compensate their messing up with anything. I had to pay for my airport hotel stay as we were not willing to wait two hours for just visa processing and then going out of the airport for their complimentary stay. Also, the fact that Dubai airport is so huge makes things more difficult with a baby to be walking a lot. All in all, very bad experience and would not recommend Emirates."

Interestingly enough, my friend who was flying with an American passport was given accommodation within the airport. He had a 10h layover unlike me who had 13.

When i got there i was told it was per piece not per KG and i had to pay more. i agreed and tried to give them cash, they refused and insisted that i must pay by credit card which i did not have, eventually an argument ensued and their assistant mgr came and instead of resolving the conflict, he told me not to board the flight and i left. I have been asking for my refund from Emirates and they said i did not meet their conditions of carriage because of an argument.  I was perplexed and i have been asking for my refund and they provided no proof whatsoever to back up their claims.  I am still asking for my money or a new ticket from Emirates. Customer Affairs asked me to contact their security which i did and the security said it had nothing to do with them. They were essentially giving me the run around instead of being professional. The agent asked me to go ahead and claim a refund for the unused sector which i did but was denied, i have sent her multiple mails and she does not respond to emails or calls. Emirates customer affairs are extremely unprofessional. Emirates is not a good airline and their service is sub-par at best. "

Food is very mediocre (chicken tikka masala with rice on both legs of my journey inbound and outbound!) and planes are tired. The food service comes on a night flight after 3 hours when people are asleep. Today I have been waiting for over 2.5 hours for luggage in Heathrow london. These glitches can happen but there is not a representative in sight. Customer service needs some retraining.

The crew were very pleasant and attentive but one passenger was on a cellphone and largely reclined until take off and I had to ask crew to silence him, on landing he refused to wear a mask to cover fully his face and another passenger complained and I asked a steward to intervene.

A380 gate at MAN is always hard work but this was totally chaotic with ground staff failing to get a grip. We queued for 20 mins to board but found we were in the wrong queue, the one to get reallocated from the cancelled flight. This was because staff failed to tell anyone what was going on. 90 mins late we took off, full flight. It was ok but the number of babes in arms crying meant no sleep, food was the usual but due to being full it was slow. On arrival we were all herded without announcement for an additional no option PCR test which was also chaotic, although it was free. Return flight EK19 on 10/02 was better serviced, on time and food was better but yet again the crying babes meant no sleep whatsoever. Bottom line is the A380 gate at MAN is still not fit for purpose and because of the popularity of those with very young children we won't be rushing back."

At the beginning everything was ok but when the plane took off they put AC on and it got extremely cold. As we and many other people on this plane were flying from hot country to hot country nobody was thinking to put on any warm clothes, the only one thing that was helping everyone were the blankets. I did inform the flight attendant twice but they didn’t do anything with that. Maybe there are some areas on the plane where it is not that cold but they didn’t offer us any help though we had a baby and baby was cold. We fly a lot and such situation has never ever happened to us. Crazy freezing flight. The company doesn’t care about the costumers. Service was not good as well.

Emirates advertised on their website that tickets are flexible (due to COVID) and can be changed or cancelled at anytime without any additional cost. My return flight got cancelled due to COVID and I requested a refund so I can book a flight home with another airline. Not only did they refund only about 20% of the price I paid but they also didn't refund my miles I used for this flight. In my opinion this is very misleading advertising. It is also the third time within a year where Emirates has disappointed and not lived up to their promises.

Our flight was delayed by an hour from Barcelona. We let the crew know multiple times that we had a connection to catch. They told us not to worry, there'll be ground crew waiting for us once we land and will make sure we don't miss our connection. But #Emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight, this was 6 hrs before landing. Once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid-way the #Emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation. They're rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived, tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew. Also both my partner & I had picked up a cold virus (not Covid, got the negative PCR) and felt horrible. We were both feverish, barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly. First they gave us seats far away from each other twice. I couldn't understand how they could make the same mistake twice. Second they told us we can't get the exit row seat, we'd paid extra for. They told me, it wasn't their responsibility to refund the money and I should request if from Emirates.  I just requested that we wouldn't be seated near any small babies and they said fine. They kept telling us to collect our luggage, but with the condition my partner and I were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up, it was impossible. So we said no. Since no one was helping and it was 3 am, we thought to go and check in to our hotel & sleep. We were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it, go visit the Dubai Expo and all. But things just started getting worst. We were in nightmarish state until we got home. We had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel. The Emirates crew at the Airport entrance couldn't help us with Expo tickets, cause they didn't care. We had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours. And the hotel had no amenities. After multiple arguments, the meal problem was fixed, which wasn't that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries. We'd to go and buy clothes, toothbrush, deodorant, etc for ourselves which was a waste of money. The hotel couldn't even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining. We survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine, were actually not. We ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration, there were empty seats at the end of the plane, they just didn't bother to check for us. I did ask for a change of seat at the gate and in flight and every time I was told there were no empty seats. We arrived at Syd airport in a chaotic situation to collect our luggage. They'd given the wrong belt, so everyone spent an hour at luggage collection. "

In the airport, they offered us a new ticket and we had to stay in the airport overnight. The airport was not suitable for a family stay, and we could not use the lounge with a economy ticket. The airport staff were rude and they did not do much to help. They gave us vouchers for dinner, but the restaurant that we went (Gallery) gave us the lowest quality of food with that voucher.

112,December 2021,Washington to Dubai,Family Leisure,M Rubin,2nd January 2022,2,na,2,1,1,4,1,Economy Class,2,2,Trip Verified,poor experience from start to finish," This was a poor experience from start to finish.  Arrived at the airport to find there was a four-hour delay to the flight. Emirates, however, did not check in bags so no one could go through security or otherwise move to an area with seats available (there were about 30 seats in the area for 200+ passengers). There was very little communication about what problem, if any, caused the delay. Ultimately, Emirates did begin check-in and then began a shuffle of repeated delays until, about seven hours later, Emirates cancelled the flight. Very little communication. ""Maybe there will be a flight tomorrow."" Called Emirates and no answer. Tried online chat without success. Ultimately turned to twitter to get rebooked (had onward flight). This in turn led to the agent trying to charge me an additional several thousand dollars because of fare differential between flying days. I pushed back hard on that, but got the sense Emirates simply sought to profit. Agent tried to put me on a flight in which I would miss my connection to a city served only once every five days by air. Emirates, unlike other airlines, won't book passengers on cancelled flights onto other airlines. Ultimately, Emirates added an additional flight the following day. Told us to get to airport four hours before, but then wouldn't check-in rebooked flight until two hours before so the two flights wouldn't get confused (why then have us in area with no seats and tell us to just stand there for several hours?). Onboard, seats were cramped. My child got a ""kids meal"" she didn't ask for which consisted of one burnt chicken nugget! Service was lackluster. I've flown more than two million miles on other airlines; Emirates was down near the bottom. Seems they are seeking to coast on their reputation but are no longer willing to do the bare minimum."

However getting my luggage was a nightmare! I as well as almost all of the passengers had to wait for over one hour staring at the carousel for our luggage to come out. We landed on time and going through customs was very fast. Arrival was at about 9 pm, I was done with customs by 9:20 pm, BUT I had to wait at carousel 1 from 9:20 pm until 10:45 to get my luggage. Although Emirates may say that they're not responsible for what happens outside the airline, the passenger is charged a fee for going through Newark Airport, and therefore the airline is also responsible. One other issue which may seem unimportant, but it actually is very important: The entertainment is extremely difficult to use as I when I played a movie a radio station presenter came on with advertisements. Despite trying several times, I could not get it to go to movie sound mode. Ground service I place a one star as I said earlier, Emirates is also responsible for the huge delay of not only my, but almost all of the passenger's luggage."

Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts. Miss May, I do hope that you will continue to choose Emirates in the future."

He helped with finding space in the overhead bins for cabin bags, was very friendly and motivated, and provided excellent service. During the entire flight he paid attention on passengers wearing their face mask, and made remarks to the ones not wearing it. In the past (before Covid19), I experienced some flights where service was lacking and unsatisfied, but this was a pleasant experience. Only negative point is the self check-in at Dubai Airport. People are guided to self check-in machines, also elderly and less frequent flyers, big families, and it takes very long time to have their check-in completed. Especially when they have excess baggage and already half of the bags have been send through. After completing check in, still have to queue up for passport and PCR verification at another Emirates desk, which makes the self check-in less convenient. Nevertheless great experience again."

We flew Emirates from Los Angeles (LAX) to Dubai to attend the Dubai Expo 2020. It's a long-haul flight -- the flight is about 16 hours -- but my wife and I enjoyed the flight, even with the extreme length. The coach seats were comfortable, with a good amount of leg room and the IFE had a wide variety of movies, TV, and audio to keep me occupied. The cabin stewards were friendly and seemed to enjoy their job which helped make the flight even better! I look forward to flying Emirates again."

My previous flight going back to USA was business class and I was provided with a defective seat and I complained about it through their website. They did not bother to refund me for that trip. Coming back to Karachi there was a total lack of training and professionalism. The crew were rude and lacked time management. I am a frequent traveler and unfortunately it was the worst experience I had with this airline. I would never go again or recommend this airline.

125,September 2021,Seychelles to Dubai,Couple Leisure,A Ray,23rd October 2021,1,na,na,na,1,na,na,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,online complaint system is a mockery," My wife and I reunited in Seychelles in August 2021 after being separated by the pandemic. We had planned to return to the Philippines where she is a citizen. Upon checking in for our first flight with Emirates, the supervisor said I needed a visa since I was a USA citizen. We attempted to explain that Philippines allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. However, the supervisor stated their system did not list these other provisions. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan had been allowed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily. We agreed to follow up during normal business hours since this was Friday night. When I asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry with my wife. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. We incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And our connecting airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success. I did not receive any corrected documentation about the offloading, any financial compensation or flight credits, not even an apology acknowledging their initial mistake! Each time they continued to cordially reiterate that they took ""the matter seriously"" and ""have nothing further to add."" International travelers, especially Filipinos, should beware flying Emirates! They're playing the role of immigration without the knowledge or authority to do so. The online complaint system for Emirates is a travesty of a mockery! You can only upload 2 documents at a time. And you can't make multiple submissions without waiting for Emirates to reply. A week or two later. There's no one you can talk to about matters like this by phone either! I asked to speak with supervisors and managers multiple times without any success. Each time they referred me to the (useless) online complaint system. I don't even know why they bothered to send me delayed replies. They didn't address any concern or ever explain why the airport supervisors could approve me to rebook and board but the online customer service could make say something completely different."

But, what was controllable, was the level of customer service. No customer should be told that they cannot rebook with another airline after an airline has breached they ticket contract or else they would not receive a hotel voucher. I believe this is the era of choice? The customer doesn’t put themselves in the unfortunate position of an airline being in breach of their airline ticket. And should a customer then choose another airline to reach their destination, the airline should know that the customer did not choose to have to rebook a flight. Nevertheless, the flight a customer chooses should be entirely up to them, given the option. Emirates should never try to hold people hostage after they mess up!  Customers should never be ridiculed for not choosing an airline they no longer trust. Emirates needs a serious training of their staff on customer service, or simply just learn the term, because what I experienced should just not be an experience anyone goes through."

The business class seats are narrower than those on EVA Air, Singapore and Qatar. They are also not real full-flat sleeper seats as they do not recline to 180 degrees. For a very large business class cabin seating 50+ it has two small, narrow, windowless lavatories. On this flight one of the lavatories flooded and remained so on the entire route. The wine selection was decent but the food was utterly inedible and honestly hideous to look at. All I could eat was the soup and it was heavily salted. I've had much better food in economy class of poorly rated airlines. Last and least, the entertainment system was difficult to operate. Was anything good? Yes, the staff was excellent and so was the car service.

But recently, when I took my pregnant wife to board the Emirates flight from Mexico City to Dubai with a stopover at Barcelona, they inform me that I cannot travel since I do not have a transit visa at Barcelona and it is mandatory to disembark at Barcelona. This was not the case earlier. Emirates Mexico team was sitting on this information for 2 months and have never updated to a passenger.

I contacted Emirates customer services and asked about any alternative flight, and they answered that they could not do it. They proposed later flights on 16 July, but it was impossible for us because we had visas valid until 14 July. I told him about it. So, they suggested requesting a refund, I did it, but they refunded a small percentage of ticket costs. I had two two-way tickets that cost 800 USD each. They refunded 188 USD for one and 250 USD for another for one-way tickets. Then I knew that Emirates for such a canceled flight suggested Turkish airlines, but the customer service did not suggest this option for me.  I am very disappointed that Emirates canceled the flight and did not suggest how to fly from departure to the final destination. Besides, they refunded not the full amount of one-way ticket costs. I wrote feedback-complaint several times to Emirates, and they answered that the flights had been canceled according to the OAE government and could not help me. "

We got according to new tickets, that we had to stay in Dubai almost 3 days for connecting flight!!!! And I discovered it by chance! When I called to agent to fix this problem, she told me that I have to pay $1,000 extra because they do not have same class tickets, while it was not my choice to change travel dates. I had to go in person to ticketing agent to solve the problem with return tickets dates to be able to come back to work in time after vocation.  The ticketing agent said, that to be able to return on that date I will have to stay in Dubai 25 hours while on initial reservation it was 17 hours.

They shout at you to do this and do that. The customer service from Emirates in that Airport is terrible to say the least. Anyway we get there and the guy checking us in tells us our booking is unavailable, that we need to leave the line - no explanation no nothing! We came to learn later that UAE had a new fly rule regarding long layovers for passengers from India. Now I don't know if they knew that but an apology would have been considerate regardless. We did pay over $1500 dollars for that ticket after all. Mind you we even had the e-ticket from Emirates with the confirmation and everything. Honestly I get much better customer service riding an Uber at 1/hundredth of the cost. Super disappointed. "

For a family of five with a little child with us, spending nine hours at the airport was really a very bad experience. I booked my flight in April and I chose a three-hour connection for the august 13 trip from Tunisia to Bahrain. The eve of the flight, I found out that the flight has changed and the connection had been extended from three to nine hours. I spend more than one hour running with my kids and suitcases from one connection desk to another trying to get a lounge to spend the night but in vain. No one at the airport knew what they were doing. I finally went to the only hotel in the airport and to my surprise, we had to pay more than 3000UAE dirhams to stay overnight! Did I ask for my trip to be suddenly changed? Did I ask for my connection to be extended? Did the company notify me and provide me with a hotel room to spend the night with my kids? Who did you fly in the 2 am flight that we initially booked and paid for?"

During airport procedures I was injured with a small finger cut so once we are in the air after switching off seat belts sign I pinched the attendant button, and for 40 min no one came, to the limit I went to attendants place to request band aid. I have a boy and a girl where one got served with kids food and the other not for 30 min till I stood up again and requested for the food, and the answer I was provided that “sorry the oven is broke”. I had to take the same airline traveling back to Dubai for some work and I hoped to have a different experience, once I approached the check in counter I was informed that the flight is delayed with 105 min, and the flight took off  Delayed more with 150 min.  I wrote to customer service to compensate such loss who took them 2 days to reply my complain explaining how they are aiming for best customer service and trying to be number 1 and by the end they told me nothing and no compensation.

The flight from Dubai to Cairo was almost at equal standing, bathrooms were dirty most of the time though, the main problem that will prohibit me from recommending this airline to anyone is the experiences that I had with their ground crews in Chicago and in Dubai. Counter check-in and package drop off process overall with Emirates were the least efficient out there between the other lines that were checking in at the same time, needless to say that I spent almost 45-60 mins to finalize this step while the whole infamous TSA passport control process took less than 15 mins from start to finish on that busy day. When I finally made it to the check-in counter and I presented my Emirates compliant (not country-specific, Emirates ask for more than that) PCR test, they questioned whether or not I meet the time requirement simply because they compared the sample collection date and time in (CST) with the final destination departure time which was in Dubai local time without accounting for the time difference, after explaining that she took the test and disappeared for 10 mins before returning with the stamp of approval. Right after that she printed our 3 boarding passes for the trip to Dubai and beyond and asked to place our two carry-ons and two backpacks containing our personal items (our laptops, tablets, snacks, medicine, toys, and a change of cloth for our 4-year-old toddler) she stated that they will all be treated as carry-ons and that we were only allowed to bring two of them on board, and that if we don’t we will need to pay $200.00 in extra fees, or we can take our backpacks and check-in our carry-ons, she explained that this carry-ons restriction were a company policy imposed due to Covid, what does Covid has to do with the carry-ons and personal items allowance policy? I never had this experience ever with any other airline including my previous flights thru Emirates & Etihad, no one ever considered my laptop carrying bag as a carryon it was always listed as a personal item which I was allowed to bring on board to stow underneath my seat, I was in a state of shock and I told her that those carry-ons contained items with rechargeable batteries but that didn’t seem to sway her mind, I was in no position to argue at that point and took as much as I could from those rechargeable items form those carry-ons stuffing it into our backpacks just to follow my own safety protocols, on flight I saw many passengers boarding the airplane with their carry-ons and backpacks, and I highly doubt that they paid the $200 they wanted us to pay at the counter! Finally, the point where I completely snapped asking to see the supervisor on-site is when she-alongside another colleague of hers stated that my toddler' aviation approved child seat was not allowed inside the cabin and then they tried to charge me for an extra fourth seat claiming that to bring this on-board I’ll have to pay for an extra seat! I was like my child is 4 years old, we paid for his seat ticket of which we will place this child's seat! nothing changed their mind until the supervisor came, and I told her that we have three tickets for all 3 passengers, and she agreed with our point of view. Filed a complaint with their customer service to get a generic response."

Second, I asked for water 3-4 times, then they provided me with a cup of water, not a bottle of water. (It's strange to have this in corona time). Third: the food was not tasty at all, it was very cold. Fourth, they announce that the internet is free to use, but in reality, it needs the passenger to pay money to have it. (And hosts not supported any passenger to get free internet). Fifth, they start collecting the headset 20 minutes before the flight ending so you couldn't keep watching the movie.

Their website is not updated and they do not take responsibility for lacking to keep the passengers up to date with Covid travel requirements. I booked my flight two months in advance and checked the Emirates website daily in preparation for it. I am fully vaccinated but still needed a negative covid result, no problem, I got it done. When I got to the airport they said the covid result needs to be stamped. Turns out, all labs in the USA are FDA regulated and do not stamp their results for authorization. The only place that does so is inside the airport, by appointment and costs $175. I learned all of this as I was checking in for my flight. So there is obviously no time to make it and I had to miss my flight. Normally, airlines take responsibility for this and accommodate the passenger by rebooking them free of charge. Not Emirates, their reservations/customer service first said that the next flight is 11 days out, and then gave me no choice but to pay another $2000 to book a seat. I've never experienced anything like this with any airline. They are usually accommodating and not money hungry."

He booked Emirates hoping that they provide what they promise during this pandemic (safe flights, hygienic, booking half the flight's capacity, etc) but my dad had a horrible experience. The flight was fully booked which was quite bothersome at a time when everyone around the world are practising social distancing, the faucets in both the lavatories in his proximity were overflowing and I was told that the crew had been wearing the same masks throughout the 13-14 hour flight. This is an epitome of how Emirates treats its non-premium class as the ""cattle-class"" and that basic hygiene and comfort don't really matter for those who decide to fly at a lower rate. Really ashamed at Emirates for the inequality that they show. During these unprecedented times, they must take into account the passenger's health and safety rather than looking at profits. Please provide what you promise, Emirates. Your advertisements with the cabins being sanitized and having fully vaccinated crew (who knows?) really are just for attraction, aren't they?

My wife and children ticket were confirmed for Hotel and they were told that boarding pass is sufficient for the hotel but the staff at the Dubai airport are asking for a voucher for the hotel. My friends on the same flight go the hotel but my wife is currently at terminal 3 wondering what to do and this is their first time traveling without me. I was not expecting this from you Emirates.

Chauffeur service was punctual on time, Business class lounge at both DXB and CAI were spacious and clean, of course services has been adjusted due to pandemic. Check in was friendly and keeping social distancing, service on board was excellent, crew were always available and very friendly on both flights and always engaging. Luckily flight was half empty on outbound and almost empty on the return back to DXB. Traveling with my elderly mother during pandemic was made easy and smooth thanks to Emirates."

After paying a large amount and flying in business class, they tell me that they did not have any non veg food left. All they have is some vegetarian curry and the remaining food is over. It was unbelievable that a flight such as Emirates would give such poor treatment to its loyal customers. Please do not consider travelling by business class, it really doesn't make a difference. They will say they have No food to give and just to save their face, they brought me coffee and drinks from first class. Utterly discontented with the service and staff."

However having the ticket in hand, as a frequent flyer, I am told that there is no availability to upgrade with points; only a payable upgrade is offered. After contacting the airline, they confirm that only payable upgrades are available. With the current policy of Emirates there is no need to become a frequent flyer with Emirates as they offer nothing to a passenger who has enough points to upgrade."

The food was horribly over seasoned, the highlight being the champagne. All of that was still quite manageable. The flight back was the real fail. We picked this aircraft specifically for safety and spacing during COVID. They switched the flight the night before and left us in a bulkhead middle seat, surrounded by coughing strangers. They had an entirely empty first class section available, which they wouldn’t let us pay for or upgrade to for the flight. While speaking with customer service they were equally unhelpful. There is no service left on this airline, especially in a time where rebuilding travel and customer safety/comfort is so important. Avoid Emirates- the hype is not delivered upon!"

Entire business class cabin is furious as moved from 2-2-2 new seats airplane to old 2-3-2 configuration where families and couples have been split up and all kinds of Covid infractions are happening. Crew says this 'happens all the time and people are always mad'. Probably a dodgy cost save that puts people at risk. Far from the ritzy commercials you see this is a second rate business class experience at best. Try and book elsewhere.
158,February 2021,Amsterdam to Dubai,Family Leisure,K Martin,23rd March 2021,5,Boeing 777,4,3,1,3,3,Economy Class,3,3,Trip Verified,This is not a premium airline anymore,"This is not a premium airline anymore. The days of Emirates being a premium airline are long gone. By now their planes are old, seats and Inflight entertainment systems are broken. On the way up to Dubai 2 out of three seats has sound only in 1 ear. And one seat could not stay in position. The touch screen did not work. On the way back 1 seat and 1 sound system did not work out of three. They charge heavily for wifi and they charge significantly for a seat in front. At a rate where other airlines offer premium economy, Emirates just let you sit a couple of seats in front. European and US carriers by now have closed the gap and surpassed Emirates offering better wifi, premium economy and more innovative entertainment systems (Delta lets you watch from your own iPad). KLM flies this route with brand new 787's. But where an airline should make the real difference, Emirates fails even harder. Service. They get stuck in organizational bureaucracy. Emirates call centre gave you the wrong information? Your problem. That issue cost 200 euros? Your problem. The manager says no. Can I speak to that manager? No. Self-service check-in doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in another line of self-service machines. Still doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in the back of the line at the classic check-in counter (after spending 30 mins waiting for machines that don't work)? Can't check you in before you do a covid fast test. Go to a very badly signed fast test area. Everybody there is already checked in? Being around the self check-in Machines gives you a true to life Ryanair experience, but Ryanair actually does a better job. People with issues all over. And this is covid times, with a lot less traffic. I wonder what happens when it becomes busier."
159,February 2021,Dubai to Toronto,Business,M Kartiros,19th February 2021,2,na,3,2,3,3,1,Economy Class,2,3,Trip Verified,This airline is a rip off," I had the worst experience. I paid for business class special, on the day of my departure as I was checking in my luggage, I was told my passport has a hold on for an unpaid fine, I needed to go see immigration. Having 1hr 25min left, immigration advised me it was a police hold, I was to leave the airport and go to the police station near palm Jamaeria, this meant I was missing my flight, that I just updated by paying 4K cnd on top of my original ticket extra. I arrive to the police station I was not told what the issue was for but that it was resolved i still do not know why My passport was on hold. I called the Emirates to book my new flight business flight that I paid extra for, this all happen on a Wednesday they had a flight leaving everyday to Toronto direct, but the only way I could get my business seat was if I updated it to a business flex, they would not honor this seat I paid for already, saying there is none available, They booked me in an economy class as I’m sitting on the plane right now with Extra business seats available I sit in economy. This airline is a rip off, they have the worst customer service, and all they care about is how to squeeze your money out of there customer, I recommend if you plan to take business class, don’t cancel that flight because your new flight will not be business, you will half to upgrade the seat you already paid for or go first class, be prepared to pay more money. I’m sitting in Economy, when I already for my business class seat."

We filed a report at the airport before leaving and we were told that someone will get back to us and that we should check the bag status with a reference number. We contacted them over 20 times through phone calls/emails requesting at least a deadline to know that our luggage is officially lost so we can re-purchase the lost items. On every occasion they promised that someone would get back to us directly, of course no one ever did! Thinking emails might work but we only got vague replies stating that its still under tracing and asked us to fill a form with the value of all items in our bag and someone will get back to us with either our luggage or to compensate us, but that never happened. 49 DAYS LATER, we finally decided to file an official complaint on their website to which they responded that our bag arrived Dubai airport. Hence, they don't accept liability for it getting lost. I am very disappointed with Emirates."

Also, we had an incident where a flight attendant was blocking seats for another passenger and would not let us sit in the last row of economy to allow a young lady sleep the long 17 hour flight, and my wife was asked to change seats also to accommodate another young lady. It was reported to the supervisor and head of stewardess, it was not a good experience. Deplaning was disorderly, I have experienced how carriers do disembarking by rows and requesting passengers not to get up until their row is called, in this flight everyone was just pushing to get out, like there was no pandemic. Reported to Emirate, but it seems they did not take the complaint seriously."
162,January 2021,Dubai to London,Business,Ralph Jones,31st January 2021,8,A380,5,3,3,na,5,Business Class,5,na,Trip Verified,full service back on offer," Business class was quiet with around only 20 people on board and two passengers in first class. Their product onboard still excels with many areas of a full service back on offer. The main meal is a single full tray service which for me is fine. All meals are covered by plastic lids which is a slight annoyance as there is no where to put these or they fall on the surrounding areas. But we can live with this. Drinks service was constant. I visited the onboard lounge/bar which is elegant. My only continued gripe about EK business product is that their main course meals are lacklustre, look like economy meals on a china plate and do not do the rest of the product justice. Next time perhaps I will order two starters which are always superb on EK including their signature mixed mezza."

When I asked why they were risking my life in this way, the reply was that it was not mandatory not to sell the middle seat. What a shocker! Unless someone forces them, they will place you in danger in pursuit of profit. Don't fly Emirates in Covid times."

Emirates contacted me and was very apologetic – offering a change to the subsequent day. Unfortunately, I had to be in Tanzania on that day and so it is not convenient. Emirates then  offered either to keep the ticket open, for me to book again over the next two years or receive a full refund. I opted for the refund and within two days the full amount had been credited back to my credit card. Over the past few months, I have had to cancel a number of flights and have battled with airlines to get refunds. It is often been difficult even to speak to the airlines and on one occasion I have obtained a refund through my credit card company. Emirates response has been exemplary – they were proactive, pleasant and acted immediately and it is one which other airlines should follow if they are going to stand any chance of restoring their fortunes. I have frequently used Emirates in the past and would not hesitate to do so again in the future."

They changed the initial flight to leave Chicago on 18th and land in Dubai on 19th, but they didn't change our connecting flight which still left Dubai on the 18th, one day after arrival in Dubai. We caught this mistake of theirs by accident, there was no word from them whatsoever. When we tried to resolve it they said they couldn't do anything about it, basically we were stuck and they're ""sorry"", that was it. My husband was able to find a flight that would fix it and called them back, they still said they couldn't fix it until he said he was on their website looking at a flight that could. Finally they fixed it, but we still wound up paying an extra $300 out of pocket for their mistake."

My mother has been in Australia since January and was due to return in a couple of weeks. Whilst some things regarding Covid 19 are returning to a new normality - my mother is in her 90s and as such is in a particularly vulnerable group. The customer service representative was amazingly understanding and sympathetic. He changed things to enable an open return (with no penalty) and completely understood the need for her only to return when things return to a much more normal situation. I had expected to have to argue my case but the agent was so understanding. He went way beyond what I expected and couldn’t have been more helpful. A credit to his company who I hope greatly appreciate his contribution.

I visit them yesterday 9th July and to my surprise, I heard that there was a repatriation flight that left a day before which was on the 8th July and also another one is scheduled for 14th July meanwhile I called and kept calling and even use their chat platform just to let me know if there is any repatriation flight to Nigeria, but seems all the customer care I spoke with were poorly informed, how can you as a customer care or telephone operator or ticketing officer and you don't know there is a repatriation flight just to inform your clients. The biggest shock of my life was the lady at the ticketing office on 8th July around 2 pm -5 pm she shouldn't be working as a customer service personnel at all, she is badly mannered, she does not display any form of empathy all, I explained my situation to this lady and what she said was ""all flights for July has been cancelled and it's not only you"". My point is if you cancelled my flight and I already told them my situation why cant they just inform me that theren is a repatriation flight they just displayed a nonchalant attitude, meanwhile i have been following up with their flight for more than a month and several repatriation flight left and still non of them informed their customers about this, they are only happy to cancel your flight taking advantage of the situation without even informing of the next and available options for their customers.

On the airport and on the flight as well I've seen sick people, people who were coughing.  When I was flying out to Australia countries have started to introduced lockdown measures so I have decided to move my return flight forward (to make sure I don't stuck on the other side of the world). Whilst Emirates guaranteed ticket flexibility to people who were travelling during this period (they let you change the travel time) I was disgusted by the fact that if you change your return flight Emirates will charge you for a one way ticket which is double the price of a return ticket. So instead of you only paying for the difference between your new ticket and the old ticket you also have to pay for the difference between a single trip and round trip which is absolutely ridiculous and I don't think it's at all acceptable. The Emirates website was saying that all tickets are sold out for they flight I've chosen and on other flight I would have had to pay even more so I bought a ticket from Qantas (which turned out to be on an Emirates flight) I've submitted a cancellation request on my original Emirates flight on 20th March and still hasn't received any response. I could't be more disappointed with Emirates, especially that I never got my unused ticket refunded. Due to this bad experience I wouldn't use Emirates again and would talk anyone out of using them."

I am really disappointed with my return flight with Emirates. After flight resumption due to Covid, I reconfirmed my booking 5 times, on different days and they cancelled my flight 3 hours before departure. Moreover, they lied about reason for cancellation. They canceled my flight and told me CAA at Lahore isn’t allowing to land flights which was false. All other airlines we’re flying on that route and I also confirmed from CAA. Because of this, I had to have extra travel arrangements and stay at the city of departure as I came from another state."

Obviously Corona crisis happened and we all know the story how almost all flights including this one was cancelled. The terms of the ticket clearly stated that they will refund full amount if they cancel the flight. As other reviewers had mentioned as well, they have since changed their terms so that all refunds are subject to cancellation terms regardless of if they cancel or the client cancels. Thus they are refusing to refund and try to offer their vouchers instead. Being a business class flight for 4 persons it's a fairly substantial amount. Let's consider the facts for a moment. Changing contract terms one-sided after the contract has been made, is clearly illegal and is not enforceable. Second, being an EU citizen, registered in an EU country and having paid with a credit card registered in the EU, the EU regulation clearly stated that airlines must provide a refund if they cancel a flight regardless of what they terms would have said. I'm currently processing a charge-back on the credit card. ="

When I refuse this ridiculous offer I’m told they will then charge me $1000 in a cancellation fee if I try to get a refund. This is for flights they cancelled, and failure to provide a service they sold. Not something in my control, and not by any action of mine. In their lengthy Contract of Carriage it clearly states I am entitled to a full refund if they fail to fly. Apparently Emirates believes they can introduce new terms and conditions and that our previous agreed to contract no longer suits them. Had my bank try and reverse charges. After waiting 25 days was informed that their merchant bank sent an offer for a voucher, good for 24 months, and that if I then still wanted a refund I could get one then."

On the 25.03.2020 we learned that our flight had been cancelled. We contacted the Emirates customer information at Perth Airport for further information. It was confirmed that our flight was cancelled and we were told that as we were no longer a customer with Emirates how we got home was not a concern of Emirates. The phone was then hung up. We got home eventually with Qatar Airways where we had to pay twice the normal cost for regular seats. Since getting home we have been offered vouchers which we have refused saying we want a refund of the cost of the return flight. We have been told that any refund (if offered) may take many months and it is unlikely that Emirates will agree to a full refund for the return flight which they cancelled. What a way to treat it's customer. A disgrace. We will never fly with Emirates again.

I had great expectations after learning that this was the number one airline in the world. It is far from being so, it doesn’t even qualify to be within the first 50, unfortunately. The customer service officials are so ill informed that they can hardly be of help to the customers. They have only canned answers. The travel segment referenced to in this review was understandably canceled because of the covid pandemic. So then I called up to cancel the ticket the customer service diverted me to another website and made me fill out the entire form and submit cancellation. He said it is going to take two weeks for the refund, which was fair. Emirates is misusing the disaster to its advantage and abusing the customers. Now they say it is going to take 90 days to refund the amount. Now there is no way I can get back without being refunded the amount. Their responses are very poor. An airline quality and service is better judged at the time of an exception. Emirates has failed to live up to it’s Customer expectation. Most other airlines I had booked have already refunded my money. So that gives us a relative sense or comparison."

I sent the refund form and request to be refunded and waited for almost 3 weeks but no response or refund came through. When I contacted Emirates on 6th April the sales representative said I will be charged if I request for refund. How silly and illogical is this? Emirates cancelled the trip and now it wants to charge me for cancellation? Why should I be charged for refund if the airline is cancelled the trip or whatever is the reason that it is not the passengers fault. "

Refused to book me a seat on another airline when there was many available. They couldn't care less about their customers or their (supposed) duty of care to them. A flight voucher is really useful when you've grounded all your planes and the world is under quarantine for an unknown length of time and I have to get home swiftly before borders are closed. Emirates immediately closed all of their regional customer service centres and it was impossible to get through on their jammed phone line. I had to pay out of my own pocket to book a ticket with another airline.

It was the the most horrific flight. From the time we left Brisbane until Dubai the washrooms were disgusting No hand tissue, no hand soap, the floor was littered with hand tissue and wet from urine and or water. The floor was sticky to walk on. As were were seated adjacent not far from the washrooms it was easy to observe the cabin crew very rarely checked the washrooms. There was an over use of the seat belt signs to ensure customers were seated rather than annoying the crew serving meals I was given the choice between beef and chicken and when I chose beef was informed there was none left but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes perhaps there maybe some left over. Sure enough 20 minutes later a beef meal arrived and was promptly dumped on the meal tray and was stone cold. The crew through the 15 hours were noticeably aggressive to all and sundry. The toilets were locked 20 minutes from landing in Dubai and my wife had to beg to use the washroom. Whilst we were informed this was the last flight out of Australia I guess the crew were coming to grips with loosing their jobs. Sorry but they still should have been professional until they finished their shifts. I have since written to Emirates feedback but no response. We hold return tickets to Australia and can only hope for a better experience. Having wished for a long time to fly with this airline on the recommendation of others, what a complete disappointment I have flown the major airlines over the ast 40 years and ""never"" had anything to equal this most over rated airline."

When travelling by Emirates it is advisable to ensure that your luggage is secure and that you do not use back packs, duffel bags or any other type of bag whereby a zip can be seperated to allow baggage handlers access to your luggage. Emirates apply a 7 day policy for making claims for stolen items, and are not prepared to consider any reasonable evidence if you are not able to make a claim within those 7 days. When raising a complaint with Emirates, customer service is appalling and respond via email with a 'no reply' email address. Business class was very comfortable and the 'add ons' including lounge and chauffeur service made the journey a lot more comfortable. Not sure if it was really worth the money though.  Unfortunately, the customer service when making complaints was appalling and the response I received was from a 'no reply' email address."

It was my first experience flying with Emirates and without the slightest doubt will be my last. I believe that critical situations bring out the true nature of people as well as companies and it is my opinion that Emirates came out as uncaring, irresponsible and thoroughly unethical. I had a return flight from the Netherlands to the Philippines and I was supposed to fly back from Cebu to Amsterdam at the end of March, but I became stranded due to the suddenly imposed lockdown. The situation became quickly truly dreary with flights getting cancelled by the hour and airports getting closed with almost no notice. The military being deployed in Manila and checkpoints set up to allow only tourists with a ticket for a flight leaving in the next 12 hours to enter. Tourists were informed to leave the country on 20th March at the latest. My domestic flight to Cebu was cancelled on 17th March and I desperately tried to contact Emirates to make the appropriate changes but to no avail: on their website, there was only a local telephone number to which nobody ever answered. I asked friends to contact the Emirates Dutch local office on my behalf, but they ended up with the same result, nobody answered the phone or Facebook messages. On 17th March a rescue flight was organized by a local private company, I landed in Clark International and went straight to the local Emirates office. The representative simply told me that they could not do anything for me because flights were fully booked, informed me that Clark airport would also be closed in 48 hours and told me that I had to figure out a solution myself. I had to purchase an incredibly expensive new flight with another airline departing that very same evening from Manila and rush against time to make it to the airport on time (I made it just thanks to the kindness of strangers who offered me a ride in a private transfer van). In the span of the following few hours i met at least a dozen travelers who had flights with KLM and who told me that KLM (not an airline partner) had rebooked all of them on Emirates flights. To summarize, Emirates made it impossible for stranded travelers to contact the airline, declined and shirked away from all responsibilities to find a solution, offered me no assistance and no compensation whatsoever, had no qualms to give away a large number of their seats to other (non-partner) airlines, but did not offer its own customers the same courtesy.

My ticket showed gate A3, but on checking the board, it showed B3 and this is where the main problem was. On arrival at the gate there was a long line waiting at the gate. I found out that First and Business class were to board by gate B2. There was nothing on the sign at the gate to state this. The handling agents seemed to be unsure of what there were doing. Then economy, business class and first class passengers were herded onto the same bus to be taken to the aircraft. On arrival in Dubai, was taken from the airport to a hotel to freshen up and have something to eat, even though it was 01.30hrs.

I've been on hold for the part 31 minutes, waiting to speak to the representative, and this isn't the first time I've waited this long. Most accommodation and travel websites are allowing full refunds (like Airbnb, bless them), whereas I was kindly informed by Emirates that they would still charge me SG$400 for cancellation despite the extenuating circumstance that neither is my fault nor something anyone could have seen coming (As of 16th March, Australia's government implemented a 2-week isolation period for all international passengers, making it financially infeasible to make the trip).

Rest of the time you have to ring the bell or go to the gallery to ask for drinks. The head purser wondering around the cabin with a tablet, the while flight. Why they keep needing to look at a tablet in a flight I don't know. Another cabin crew sitting down on a laptop for at least an hour. Why cabin crew need to use a laptop on a flight I don't know.

I thought Emirates offered an extremely family-friendly service as I was travelling on my own with my 17-month-old son. They were extremely attentive throughout all of my flights. I thought the food was of a decent standard - they could have offered an extended drink service but if you wanted a second or a third drink you only had to ask. Some of the flights had a velcro cover for the bassinet which I did not like as my son could easily open it but the London to Dubai leg had a zip which made me feel at ease that he was safe. The flight attendants were happy to look after my son when I needed to go to the toilet and on a couple of flights, some of the attendants went the extra mile and carried my son around the plane to give me a break. They had bottled baby milk and organic baby food which was a first for me when flying with my children. On the way to New Zealand I flew to Lon-Dubai-Bali-Auckland and I preferred this to the return leg when I flew direct from Auckland to Dubai which was nearly 17 hours and I would not recommend it with a toddler. I thought the inflight entertainment was of a high standard but I could not connect to the Wifi on any of the flights. Some of the aircraft were a little tired and the seating could have done with replacing but overall I found Emirates offered a good service for a father taking his 17-month son all the way to New Zealand on his own."

While the previous flight with an Emirates A380 went OK, the connecting flight from Dubai to Amsterdam was terrible. In Dubai, the security check is at the gate, so it is not possible to bring a bottle of water with you. With this fact, Emirates does not bother to supply its passengers with an extra bottle of water during the flight but brings just one small cup of water at mealtimes. During the flight, the Emirates staff gathered at the rear pantry and were talking loud for a long time. Could not sleep with this irritating loud chatting. The toilets were not once cleaned during the 6.5-hour flight. Several toilets had a malfunction with water and some toilets had urine on the floor. Terrible! The seats were not very wide, narrow in fact, and had a hard seat. It was a claustrophobic experience. The seats have had their best years long ago. I have flown Emirates for many years and was always more or less satisfied, but the quality is going down the last two years and now at a level, I decided not to fly Emirates any more."

Manchester to Brisbane via Dubai. I flew economy and does not do hot towel services or give out mini amenity kits. I was disappointed that Emirates only had black or green tea as their tea options. These minor elements aren't that much of an issue but the big deal breaker was the in-flight service. On my route from Manchester to Brisbane I had 3 flights all with separate crews and the service I received on the first two flights was awful. The staff were at best indifferent and at worst extremely rude and act like they are above you and the feeling of ""How dare you ask for assistance"" came across quite strongly with the most of the staff. Maybe I just had bad luck, but I will be flying with Emirates again soon long-haul economy so I guess we will see if it was just a once off."

The plane used to Cape Town, is a very old 777, full of scratches with broken seats. Overall Emirates makes nice a video, advertising and promising the Emirates experience that in reality is to fly in substandard plane and the level of service Now the same of a mainstream airline. Obviously you still pay Emirates price. On top of this they are totally careless about frequent flyer, so If you fly for business choose other airlines."

First flight with Emirates after several years using other airlines and I must say standards have slipped. Emirates used to be a cut above, with better food, IFE and more generous alcohol supply. Now they are very run of the mill and when you add in the inconveniences of Dubai airport compared with other options in the gulf they are solidly average. I used them because Stansted is my local airport, so their flights are convenient and because of this will probably reluctantly use the company in future. Low point of my 4 economy flights was the unsmiling, unfriendly and arguably rude crew member I had looking after my part of the cabin on the outward leg from STN. Not once in 7 hrs did I see her make eye contact or smile at anyone, including her colleagues. The other crew I encountered were generally friendly and reasonably efficient. The seats felt worn and were not as comortable as I remember, probably as the aircraft are generally ageing across their fleet. The food ranged from edible to fairly horrible, only the IFE remains outstanding. Drinks were grudgingly supplied after a couple of hours in the air and were of indifferent quality, although top ups were available if you went to the galley."

My only criticism would be if the Orlando route was not served with the updated Business class seat that is currently available on the other US routes; the current dated lie-flat seat is only adequate for short to medium haul routes but not long flights to the US.

Over priced. Not good enough and comfortable seat for long journey. What I'm most disappointed is the service they offered during on board. Worst food and service. When you ask for extra glass of water the response is we will serve once we are free.. And that is after 30 minutes (after multiple reminders).  When I ask for nuts/snacks response was please go help yourself. Never ever try Emirates again. Moreover my luggage was damaged.. Send them mail after mail. No response from them after a month or so.
220,February 2020,Ho Chi Minh City to Newark via Dubai,Business,S Robert ,16th February 2020,3,Boeing 777-300ER,3,3,2,2,2,Business Class,2,3,Not Verified,Emirates is way overpriced for what you actually get," I've flown business class (as well as premium economy) many times on long-haul flights between Asia and the US, on a pretty wide variety of airlines. For my current trip, there appeared to be a reasonably good business class fare (but not the best fare among all airline selections) to NYC via Dubai on Emirates, apparently because of a long (7+ hour) layover in Dubai. Even though it wasn't the best business class fare available among all airlines, and the layover was longer than I'd prefer, I chose Emirates based on their reputation. However, Emirates doesn't inform you when purchasing the ticket, and you don't find out until you arrive at the airport in Dubai, that this business class fare does not include any lounge access. So, you basically get a slight discount on a business class fare, but no business class lounge access during a 7+ hour layover. Also, on the Emirates 777-300ER, the business class seat does not actually lay flat (its angled quite a bit), and the leg / foot section of the seat when extended is rather flimsy. Unless you have a child-size body, it's quite difficult to get comfortable for any actual sleep on a long haul ""business class"" flight with the type of seat that Emirates installed on the 777-300ER. Based on my actual flight and in-airport experiences, I'd rank business class on other airlines much higher than Emirates business class. For long haul travel between Asia and the US, I'd even rank Philippine Airlines business class in a higher category than Emirates, particular because Philippine Airlines business class fares are typically several to many hundreds of USD cheaper than Emirates best business class fares, and you aren't subjected to any undisclosed trickery relating to business class lounge access. I'll avoid Emirates in the future, for sure - Emirates is way overpriced for what you actually get. Come to think of it, for a route between Asia and NYC through the Mideast, I'd have to say premium economy on Qatar Airlines is a much better value for the money, with a reasonably good comfort level as well as excellent service, as compared to Emirates business class."

I found the seats very comfortable on both aircraft. I appreciate that some do not like the slight incline of Emirates' lie-flat seats on the 777 but it's never bothered me and I had 6 hours' sleep on the leg to DPS.

We boarded our flight and proceeded to wait on the tarmac for 3.5-hours! The flight was then canceled but because we started calling customer service while on the tarmac we were 2 of 300+ people that were able to get on the next flight which then waited on the tarmac for 1 more hour making us miss our connecting flight which then made us miss our next connection. The worst part was when we got to Dubai we had a 5 hour layover until our next rebooked flight. Emirates wouldn't get us a hotel because it was less than 8 hours and they wouldn't let us in their lounge because we weren't business class. We sat at the airport 2 hrs for our flight, we sat on the tarmac for 3.5 hours, then we sat on the tarmac for 1 hour, then we sat on the flight for 4 hours and got to the airport and were told there was no compensation, no accommodations, no customer service. We needed to sit at the airport for 5 hours until we could sit on our 14-hour flight. We spoke w, 3 different representatives, at different counters as well as customer service on the phone and Emirates refused to take any responsibility for 2 extremely late flights and the nightmare we were going through. I heard Emirates was nice and took care of their customers but that is definitely not true."

I bought an Emirates student fare one-way ticket as they promoted in China, so the value for money is relatively good. I initially just wanted to use it as an opportunity to experience A380 (my first impression of Emirates at that time) as well as avoiding more expensive one-way fare of British Airways, but it turned out that the flying experience was really more stable than  other planes I had experienced, and the touchdown on the runway was also the best experience in my lifetime. The seat was a little bit too narrow for me, so I gave only four stars. The meal was really delicious and fitted well to my taste."

After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed. Our first leg from Brisbane to Dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal. Not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but I had to ask them again for the second meal. Approximately 4 hours out from Dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above. After 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue. Passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us. Following this there was no in-flight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight. No compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident. After our horrendous flight and poor service from Brisbane, I asked at Heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to Brisbane were fully booked. This was not true as the Dubai to Brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves. The check in procedure at Heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes. There were no toilets in the lounges at Heathrow and Dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again. Our flight from London departed at 9pm. My daughter didn’t end up getting her meal until 11.50pm. It took them 2.5hrs to commence the meal service. The flight from Dubai to Brisbane was no better. My 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadn’t been cleaned. My 7 year old fell asleep on take off so I asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up. I was told this was not a problem however when I asked for it 7 hours later I was told we she couldn’t have as they couldn’t reheat it. I then had to ask if I could at least get the other food that didn’t require being reheated. The customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling. The flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly.  On one flight I pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and no-one attended at all – the plane landed 1.5 hours after I pressed the buzzer and we disembarked. I could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence. On top of this, the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous. At one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet. We got up to go to the toilet and I was told I would be going at our own risk.  It felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work. I have travelled extensively for the past 20 years and Emirates is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Do not waste your money. I will never fly with them again."

However, the best service that I ever got on Emirates till now, was on the Dubai to Rome flight, EK 97 on the same day. The flight departed on time, cabin was clean and the cabin crew was very much on their toes to serve the passengers. I would like to particularly appreciate the service by the cabin crew Anthala . I know it is very difficult for the cabin crew to be smiling and go about their job with long hours of flying and adjusting to time differences. I would like to thank and appreciate the service provided by her on this flight. On the return flight from Rome to Bengaluru, the service on the flights was not up to the standards of Emirates."

I am totally disappointed with their service. During check in when I asked to provide a seat near to my family members (traveling on the same route, but different PNR), the check in agent did not replied anything, but issue the boarding pass with the seat which was randomly assigned 48 hrs prior to the departure. However, the DXB-JFK flight was almost empty, so I can sit with my other family members. Food quality as well as quantity was tremendously poor. They served one meal just after taking off from DXB and another meal just before arrival in JFK. No other meal in between for this almost 15 hrs journey except a biscuit size pizza slice.  I pre ordered hindu non veg meal. During food service, I informed the cabin crews about my change of seat, but one crew served me a packet saying Hindu non-veg meal which was not hindu meal. My all other family members got different foods in their hindu meal.  The most confusing in the  journey was Emirates hotel policy. I booked a ticket from Emirates website with fare basis economy saver and 13 hrs stop over in Dubai having no shorter connection. My family members purchased same economy save ticket with almost same fare but from agents and they got Dubai Connect voucher. I suggest Emirates to provide the hotel eligibility during the booking process. Probably, I would not book via Emirates website then. The only good thing in the journey was availability of wheel chair in all airport."

Emirates airline failed to provide a refund for a ticket I paid for my 87 year old grandad who refused to fly on a 13 hour delayed flight. On the 13 hour delayed flight they looked after us in the UK but on the delayed 12 hour stay in Dubai they didn’t even offer us a bottle of water at the airport and then sent us to a terminal with no baby changing facilities or services for a 6 hours. I paid for a sub standard lounge myself out of necessity for my family but Emirates refused any hospitality or compensation. Inflight food was horrible. On the return journey the scones, clotted cream and jam was acceptable but the rest of the 6 meals we had on the other 3 flights were horrible. Emirates beef and mash - meat was too large and overcooked to be edible, sauce saltier than sea water and a salad of sweetcorn. Emirates directly employed staff are great but third party ground handling staff are horrible. No customer service skills at all shown in Mumbai. They didn’t even offer a buggy for my child in a massive airport and then went on to charge me an extortionate amount for 17kg excess baggage. No hospitality in Dubai, forget a lounge, no information communication or water when delayed with a family. Their profit grabbing has lead to a simple burger and fries meal costing £20 for 1 person and a sub standard lounge at £180 at my expense! By far the worst airline from the airlines I have been on: Etihad, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, South African airlines, Air India, Turkish Airlines, Indigo, BA and Cathay. Contact customer service and receive nothing citing rules where they can basically extortion money from trapped passengers. Ridiculous, never ever again."

The service is non existent and if you want a drink of alcohol you have to call or go to a section in the aircraft where you have to ask.

I upgraded my return from Dubai to Business Class and to get lounge access in Dubai. In a nutshell, my experience of the lounge and the flight was underwhelming. The Emirates Business Class lounge at Dubai airport, although huge, is dated and so big that it becomes inconvenient.  Huge, but so convenient to navigate so one has to keep walking, hoping to find anything. The food was average. The service was courteous. The flight was not even 3 hours but what really made it an unpleasant experience was the attitude of the air hostess serving my side. The welcome on board was anything but warm. I thought, maybe they are busy and it will get better. I am short and had a heavy backpack and a duty-free shopping bag in my hand. I was struggling to open the overhead bin but she did not offer to help me or open the bin for me. On the contrary, when I asked where to put it she just gestured and ignored that I was in a pickle. Thankfully, a fellow passenger got up to help me. The air hostess's attitude continued for the rest of the flight - once she was passing by and I stopped her for a glass of water and she almost did an eye roll when she stopped. I did not pay extra for this. Honestly, my experience with Emirates Economy when going to Dubai was better than this. The biggest turn off is a staff with an attitude. Fine, they probably do not like the Dubai to Pakistan sector but that is not my fault. We pay a good amount and honestly, it does not take much to be nice and courteous. So disappointed, especially when I thought Emirates business class would be the best experience. The 2-3-2 configuration is poor, the wifi never worked,. Going to avoid this from now onwards."

Due to the Ukrainian flight crash, our flight was rescheduled twice by Emirates, which means we had to have 20.5 hr of stop in Dubai. We called the airline office in Tehran to see our options of accommodation in Dubai. They said yes due to a stop longer than 13 hrs the airline must provide accommodation for you but they didn’t have access to the hotel booking system and asked us to address this issue in emirates airline counter in Dubai airport. We arrived in Dubai and asked about the hotel booking option. Surprisingly they said we cannot have any accommodation provided by airline, and it is not their problem! We had arguments about the airline policy and they were refusing to show us the policy and just giving us some wrong information that it is in their policy and they cannot provide accommodation. After 2 hrs of discussion and argument, they finally provided a twin room for three people. We were really disappointed. I had a surgery on my neck about two weeks before the flight which and had to ask the cabin crew to open the head locker for me. I asked one of the crews for the first time, he opened the head locker for me and said “don’t ask me again to do that for you, I’ve got back pain!”. I won’t fly with Emirates anymore."

As ever with this route, the Wi-Fi connectivity varied – at times it was very fast and others did not work at all. Food on the flight was tasty and the crew were diligent in ensuring that glasses were topped up. The connection in Dubai was easy, without any terminal change, and the lounge gave easy access to the aircraft.

On the return flight, the crew member got my drinks and food order wrong twice - and when I pointed it out, she looked annoyed as if it was my fault.

When bassinet were installed it is impossible to use table to tv. There is a trolley on airport but it is not suitable for younger than 6 month babies. There is no gate check for your own trolley. They do not accept it. I contacted and asked if i can checkin my carry on luggage which is so common for other airlines, they said i can but while getting boarding pass they did not accept it, so i had to go with 3 carry on luggage and baby seat in. Over all the going flight was not good. On the way back the first flight was delayed and i had less than 40 minutes to catch next flight and staff was helpful. Even though the flight had 50 minutes delay in take off. The return flight was better and we had better seats but tv and airconditionning issue still the same.

Our outbound was delayed from Newark and I was concerned on our entire flight that we would miss our connection in Dubai. The host assured me Emirates had the ability to hold any flight for up to one hour, and that we would make our connection. We arrived only to find we had missed our connection by 20 minutes. We were devastated, as this was the only flight out that day, and were told we would have to spend 24 hours in Dubai. There was no one on the ground to help us, so we made our own way to customer service. The staff were rude and completely unapologetic that we would lose 24hrs from our vacation. They told us to go to the hotel and didn't give us any guidance as to how to get our baggage, or even where our baggage would end up. The flight they rebooked us on allocated us seats at the back of the plane, as if losing 24hrs wasn't punishment enough. We then spent a further 3 hours at the airport, trying to get our seats moved and also secure our baggage. Even more concerning than all of this, there was no guidance around what it meant to enter the UAE and what we should be careful of medication-wise. When we went through customs to enter Dubai, they searched my bag and started questioning myself and my husband for sleep medication I had with me. It was incredibly disturbing and made even worse later finding out my husband had both Benedryl and pseudoephedrine - two over the counter drugs that are jailable offences in the UAE without a prescription! This is a complete lack of duty of care by Emirates.  This is disgusting behavior and not what I expect of what is said to be a premium airline. The above, and the complete lack of empathy I received from Emirates staff has been a completely awful experience. Emirates should be ashamed you are charging the fees you charge for this type of treatment."

Cabin crew were friendly, efficient and ensured that we received excellent service. One criticism – which was shared by other passengers and indeed cabin crew we spoke to – is the appalling choice of music played when boarding the aircraft. We heard a number of songs dating back to the 1970s and 1980s which we had hoped we would never hear again. Although boarding was efficient, exiting was more chaotic. The problem is that both business and economy passengers are converging on the same exit which meant that it took an inordinate amount of time get off the aircraft. Why pay for a business ticket if you can’t enjoy the advantages?"

For this trip to JFK we decided to travel 1st time with emirates. On the departure date the journey was more than 21 hours from Singapore. The staff in the plane were arrogant and unhelpful. They were unwilling to help even for taking hot water for my other baby to make milk. Imagine requesting for hot water for baby milk (1st time on to the flight) and was greeted with an unhappy face from the crew. This is not during the period where everyone were required to remain seated. We are family of 8. Our baby 24 mths old and 4 mths old were not making things easy. The staff was rude to us from the start.  We were not demanding passenger nor were we rude at any time. We had on many occasions called them by pressing the button but at all times nobody came to our seat to attend to us. This is far from what we called excellent service coming from an international airline.  They told us to put up the hand carry luggage ourselves when my 13 yr old daughter had difficulties on 1 occasion. On another occasion there were clean pair of socks on the floor and they told us to clean that up. I was appalled by the choice of words they used. They even make unhappy faces when we requested for drinks as kids were thirsty. I am not a big eater but even i find that the food provided was insufficient in portion. We should have been served a proper meal for the last meal but instead we were given a small piece of pizza. As we were all very hungry on that day and Halal food was difficult to find at JFK airport we had to travel very far to have our meal at Philadelphia, the only place we know there were authentic halal food. This is from my experience. I was never required to send a feedback on service by an airline but our experience on 24 Dec with Emirates has left us so disappointed that we have no choice but to write this review."

However the lost my bag, and as I was travelling on official business I was forced to purchase a replacement suit and medication. I first rang the emirates number in Singapore and spoke to an individual who told me they would email about the case. No email arrived. A week later I was passing through the airport again and went to the Emirates desk. The member of staff was incredibly rude, and informed me it was nothing she could help with (in fact she just sat shaking her head for most of the conversation). I then rang the Singapore number again and the member of staff informed me I would have to complain. I explained that I did not want to complain, but was just looking to have a normal conversation with a member of staff. The cost of the replacement clothes was modest. Anyway, I then used the feedback form online to send my request, and received nothing back after 3 days. Emirates do not provide an email address. My next step was to speak with someone on online chat function, who informed me it could take up to 30 days to respond to my complaint. I expressed incredulity at this number. My only conclusion is that Emirates does not do customer service - unless that is, you want to buy a business class ticket. It has been a very frustrating and sorry affair. The lack of clear information, mixed messages, is very frustrating. Individual members of staff seem to have no authority to deal with a problem, which speaks to a dysfunctional and frustrating work environment."

Great on board entertainment. Good seats. Spacious A380. Meals are just okay, they tend to run out of options frequently. Service is slow and disorganized. It's different from flight to flight. They take out blankets and headsets from the people 40 minutes before landing, while people moving to the toilets up and down aisles and it creates such a mess in the cabin. I really don't like those forceful advertisements before landing in Dubai. There are too many of them, too long, too noisy!"

I could lie down and sleep in economy class because of the low load factor.  The aircraft was well-decorated and the legroom was satisfying. nThey have the best inflight entertainment system. The tickets were relatively cheap. The cabin crew were generally friendly. Dubai is not a passenger-friendly airport. It is quite frustrating to travel around. The airport is  massive but the train does not run through the entire airport. The cabin crew had not been too eager to serve. They sat in the galley for most of the time. When a passenger needed anything, instead of hitting the bell, they went to the galley and ask for their needs. The toilets were quite dirty. Although it takes 8 hours to fly from Hong Kong to Dubai, they only serve two meals (one hot and one cold).  Passengers needed to wait for 6 hours for another meal."

I boarded Emirates flight EK255 at Barcelona airport. We were assigned D19 gate, once the boarding started they made us go down a spiral staircase to the exterior, to wait for a bus to arrive after fifteen minutes to a far away location from to board by steps.  The unacceptable fact is that once the passengers got off the bus, soaking under the storm, the crew hindered the traffic, stopping the passengers outside the airplane access door to check their documents before allowing entry, despite having credited our access at the boarding gate and when boarding the bus. It is ridiculous that security measures are so poorly coordinated that they need to check the boarding passes three times. After twenty minutes under the rain, I managed to enter the plane. Before occupying my seat seat -7K- right next to the door, a second flight attendant asked me for my boarding pass, preventing me from sitting until I showed it. It was a pleasant experience to arrive in Spain by Aeromexico, while leaving with Emirates has been a terrible disappointment."

I traveled to San Francisco  for important business meetings. After experiencing almost 4 hours of delays I was informed on my arrival (12 Jan. 2020) in SF, Emirates informed me that my baggage had been lost. I was asked to complete a form and was told that the bag would be delivered to my hotel the next day. This was already upsetting because I didn't have clean clothes and would be attending my first meeting the following morning. I was forced to buy a clean set of clothes. After being told that Emirates would be in contact with me, and having heard nothing from the company I decided to call them later that day, only to find out that my baggage would only arrive the next day (14 Jan. 2020). As upsetting as this was, I didn't want to spend more money to rectify their mistake, so I borrowed a set of clothes from my colleague for our meetings the following day. Once again, not hearing anything from Emirates, I called them the morning of the 14th to ensure that everything will be taken care of. However, when I returned to my hotel later the afternoon my bag still was not delivered. Once again, I called Emirates just to hear that there was not anything they could do to resolve my issue, I was simply asked to wait. Now I will have to spend more money fixing their mistake. The lack service, communication and professionalism I received from Emirates has been distasteful. There has been no effort from their side to rectify their mistake, which is appalling for a company who consider themselves a leader in business travel. For this reason, I believe one should rather avoid using their services if you are time-pressed and have important meetings to attend."

We were surprised to know that other passengers with us were secured seats on the next flight and already checked in! Until now we dont have any answer or information on what to do next and Emirates airlines employees refuse to give us any information and some are very rude. In addition, the Emirates application keeps on changing the flight time every 2 hrs from 12:25 to 14:00 to 16:29 to 17:00 which is very misleading and frustrating!"

Then he refused to put me on the flight and said ‘sorry you are 2 minutes late’.  Didn’t try to find a solution. Asked me to file a complaint, send back a standardized reply about timings and not referring to any of my questions. Emirates people smile and talk nicely, but when things get serious they really don’t care about their customer, have no empathy, make mistakes and even worse pretend to care.

While I made it to the gate on time, I was upset because my seat had been given away and I was rebooked on the next flight. This is also not the first overbooking incident that I have heard of. This is unacceptable as the decision for that was taken out of my hands. Having arrived at the boarding gate on time and being told that my seat was given to someone else was upsetting. When I finally got on the plane at 1.05am, there were a lot of issues with seating allocation since some families and couples were separated as well. "

KL to DXB has no issue at all. Was a smooth aircraft n service. The meals and services were good. But the problem has started with flight EK001 while flying to London. I already booked a preference seat and also requested a special hindhu vegetarian meal choice. But without my consent, there was a couple sit in my seat and asking me to exchange the seat. I didn't made any argument just accepted without any sorry and thanks from them. Later on when the special meals (veggie/kids meals) were distributing I have told a cabin crew that I made a special request for meals and exchange my seat. Please take note of it and give the meals to me to this new seat. After a second another crew came to me and begging at me said she wrongly delivered the food to the couple and accept her apologies. Still, I was keeping my calm. Later on, they offered me a bun which contains eggs. I've highlighted to the crew that Hindhu vegetarian meals doesn't contain beef and eggs. Why didn't check my request before distributing the foods. The crew came again and said  sorry.  Now same 2nd incident happened while from UK to Dubai on 31/12/19 on EK008. While the breakfast distributing I found my meals contain eggs. During lunch meals, a crew came and told me that she forgot my veggie meals request and I was offered a fruit platter. Sadly I cannot enjoy just a pineapple alone, I just avoided.  My next flight EK344 didn't offer welcome drinks and meals / snacks before landing. Emirates we pay the hefty price the service. But I didn't know you have cost-cutting strategy."

The A350 is good, but it lacks space and a bar. You can't beat it. The Emirates lounge at AKL airport is the best I have visited. Best food etc, easily. Unusually, the Emirates lounge at Dubai was fairly underwhelming. Huge, but poor food choices etc, rather mediocre for a hub of that size. Emirates staff great and helpful, friendly etc, can't fault them, Buying a BC ticket from AKL to LHR isn't cheap so price is a serious deciding factor for me.

A couple of years ago business class of Emirates and Qatar were similar but Emirates is sliding down a bit while my experience with Qatar Airways is always top. This time both flights were really not okay: Crew showed no or little interest in you and was chatting in the galley; before, cabin staff  introduced herself to each passenger, not anymore; ICE system not working properly, finally this was solved by a stewardess. Food not bad, but average, no hot towels before takeoff; no amenity kit anymore, new business class with 3 middle seats is strange choice, and claustrophobic, certainly middele seat. Second flight in an a bit outdated an not so clean 777; badly organised priority boarding for business (in fact almost none) in DXB. "

Aside of the caviar, despite Emirates still not give pearl spoons, the food could be better. For first class it was just Ok - despite the very friendly service. Emirates is very generous with the drinks in first, refills, dessert wines digestives. I did not ask for the breakfast - it was too early for me 4.30AM Dubai time. Passengers do get a pyjama and decent amenity bag. In a 777 there are 2 restrooms for a maximum of 6 people, however the space is very limited. The Belgian chocolates are replaced by some chocolates made in the UK."

Painless check-in which combined with smooth boarding ensured the wheels left the ground precisely on time, underlining what can be achieved by a competently managed airport and airline working harmony. Young mostly male crew responsive to specific calls but not seen much otherwise, e.g., water rounds during the night. Two good vegetarian meals let down by the enshrined practice of UAE major carriers of treating requesting special meals with antipathy if not contempt, no drink service and trays not collected for 2 hours or more. Given the premium price demanded by Emirates, particularly if travelling to / from the UAE, reasonable to ask for rather more."

I fly with Emirates on a yearly basis after generally having good experiences with them – even in Economy. Flying to Sydney this year it’s clear to see an awful lot of cost-cutting at play with the Economy Class product. While EK will get you from A to B in relative comfort, gone are the days of personalised service, care for passengers or the little perks that used to make travelling with them so great – with items such as hot towels having been ditched. It’s a shame to see EK go down this route, but it’s unlikely they’ll be my go to option in future – unless the price is right."

I find that when you fly Emirates you tend to get one of two types of experience in the Business Class cabin. You are either totally blown away by the friendliness and the level of service or you are totally underwhelmed and thinking that you should have spent your money elsewhere. This flight was the latter of the two. The crew could not be less interested in the passengers. They spent most of their time on the flight in the galley say down chatting amongst themselves. The flight was a night flight and they said it was a reduced service flight! I explained that I was hungry so they gave me two tepid seafood dishes - revolting. The A380 was a 2 class model and quite frankly had seen better days and looked in need of a clean. Emirates need to lift their game if they want to keep up with the likes of Qatar, Cathay, Asiana or even Qantas or Air NZ. This was a poor effort by them, they could not care less and it showed."

The service was adequate, the seat was comfortable, the entertainment was what you expect on Emirates, i.e. lots of it but not any films that I  was really excited about, but enough to keep you entertained. The only thing for me on the flight that was a stand out was the catering that was very good, as was the wine selection - which strangely enough was not top shelf wines but very good middle of the road wine. What was bizarre for me was the lack of training in the food and wine that the crew had. Did not know the wines and served the caviar with a metal spoon. I asked for a bone spoon and they said that they did not have any - and when I pointed out that metal reacts with the caviar and that is why it is not normally used, they looked at me if I was from the moon. Also bad practice was making First passengers pay for wifi. The flight was a code share with Qantas and the crew kept telling me wifi was free if I joined their FF programme. When I pointed out I was Qantas they said oh well you have to pay then. I think that that Qatar Airways QSuite business class is a better product than the EK first class, but that is just me. So nice flight, I would not rush back, neither would I have concerns about flying again."

We were able to get adjacent seats in bulkhead, giving us a good bit of leg space and being at the edge in the centre section of a 3x4x3 layout, the flight to Dubai left us feeling less cramped. The plane was organized in a way that offered spaces to stand and stretch and the bathrooms on the flight to Dubai were tidy. We were served ample meals and liquor was provided on request. Snacks were laid out in the galley. The collection of films to view was huge -- in fact, selecting from this immense library was a challenge. Good head sets were provided. Flight attendants were friendly and I thought their uniforms were attractive. The wait at Dubai to connect to Calcutta was several hours but the airport is a shopper's paradise. I found the prices on liquor competitive and there were many international shops and eateries. The terminals were clean  with ample seating. The security check between flights was smooth. At JFK on boarding, a camera snapped our picture; the boarding passes themselves were not scanned. We had economy class tickets but on boarding at Dubai, we found a cabin crew member selling empty seats in business class. He had a mobile credit card reader. We paid for two tickets. The business class was in a 2x3x2 layout and was uncrowded.  The cabin felt old fashioned and the seats did not go to 180 degrees; it was angled, but comfortable nevertheless. Attendants were  very pleasant. Duty free shopping was available and I picked up a a few cosmetics. No landing cards were provided. Neither were any amenity kits, though a pair of socks and a eye shade in a plastic wrapper was in the magazine pocket. The TV screens were on the wall separating the biz class cabin from first class. All the flights were on schedule. Emirates does not belong to any of the big 3 alliances. The only US airline you can get points with is Jet Blue. My first time with Emirates left a positive impression. If they were members of one of the alliances, I would fly with them again."

This is truly the worst airline that I have every flown in. Disgusting customer service in ground and on board. The food is horrible, from cheap Pizza to terrible taste and tough chicken for dinner. The flight attendants are horrible and disappear for hours and leave the kitchen area unattended for hours. I paid $150 extra for a seat that had extra legroom and I had people constantly stepping on my toes and they were standing in front of my seat talking and when I complained, the flight attendant went to the people and other than telling them to return to their seats, instead the flight attendants was making fun of me.

I have been a regular customer on Emirates Airlines for the last 5 years and chose this airline over many others because of the great service in the past. However, in my most recent travels, I have experienced poor management of flight connections in Dubai Airport. Due to this, I have missed several flights to New York, have been stranded in Dubai for days, have lost or missed my baggage, or have had to run at top speed to barely make it to my gate on time. There is technically only a tight 1 hour and 15-minute layover in Dubai but lately, the flight from TRV to Dubai has been arriving 30-45 minutes late due to an inability to get a gate. This of course suggests poor planning and organizing on your airline’s behalf. This delay leaves about 20 minutes for us to deboard the plane, figure out our new gate, clear security (twice), and arrive at our departing flight. It is almost impossible to do this especially for customers who are first time travelers, older, disabled, or impaired. As an asthmatic, the marathon run I had to make from Terminal C to Terminal A led to bad wheezing and could have resulted in a medical emergency if I had not carried my inhaler. Several times, we only barely made our Dubai to JFK flight because we paid for preferred seats in the front of the plane allowing us to leave quickly. Despite experiencing this incredibly stressful connection, Emirates staff provides no support to help us off the flight quickly. In fact, on our December 12th flight when we alerted the flight attended about our very tight connection (EK201 was already boarding when we landed), she dismissively told us “everyone has a connection flight not just you”. She also argued with my father and I for 5 minutes further delaying our exit from the plane. This is poor management and could be remedied by announcing the names of passengers with very tight connections. However, it seems Emirates no longer cares about their customers. Due to our marathon run, we did make our flight on December 12th, but my relief was short-lived. We were informed that all 3 of our checked bags were not loaded and would instead arrive on EK203 on December 13th at 8:00 am. On December 13th, I called the Emirates number for baggage services at 9am and was told my bags had arrived and JFK and needed to clear customs before it was delivered to my home. I was also informed that I would be updated on my baggage status- which did not occur. My family and I were put through hell to get our baggage back. We had to contact Emirates 5-7 times within the day. At one point, a chat service agent gave us conflicting information insisting that our baggage was still in Dubai despite being told otherwise many times. Ultimately after and exhausting flight and while still jetlagged we had to stay up until 2:30 am calling both Emirates and the delivery company (Bex) every hour till our bags were delivered. Due to the issues detailed above, my family and I have decided to no longer fly Emirates. . I used to be a loyal customer, but your company has really gone down the drain these past few flights and loyalty is not a good enough reason to suffer during my travels. Horrible Service. Horrible Airline."

Cannot fault Emirates, clean aircraft, good legroom, good range of food. Chose the late departure from Perth to secure A380 on all 4 legs. 2 hr stopover in Dubai both ways, had to jump on the bus between A and C Gates on way over, but not on way back. Enough signage and staff on hand to point you in right direction. Pre-selected seats which cost AUD$100 all up, but via app was able to tweak them along the way. Before my return legs home I was even able to select seats in rows 47 and then 49 in economy which were previously showing as 'preferred' at a higher cost. I even managed to score spare seats next to me. If you can sit in this smaller section of #40's rows I recommend it as board a little sooner and off quicker as use the front door - just be aware of bassinets at the front. This was my first trip with a set of noise cancelling headphones and they are worth the money! IFE all worked well, few different options for tracking progress of flight and cameras. Didnt use the wifi."
281,December 2019,Dubai to Kolkata,Business,V Hajiya,10th December 2019,1,na,4,4,1,5,4,Economy Class,2,3,Trip Verified,I am extremely disappointed," I've been travelling Emirates for over a decade for work, am a Skywards customer, and have previously always been impressed with the quality of the services on board. However, in the last few years I've seen a decline in the food quality and lounge facilities, as access has grown dramatically. All this is fine, except for a recent incident which has convinced me it's time to switch to another airline for our long haul flights. This past year I was denied boarding on a Dubai-Kolkata leg of a flight while I was enroute to a wedding.  I requested not to be the ""random"" selection for denied boarding (due to overbooking). I was told as compensation I would be given a return ticket from Dubai to Calcutta, but I explained this had no value to me as someone who lives in Canada and is not based in Dubai. The Agent then  informed me that he had made a note on the file and upon ticketing it could be changed to a ticket from Dubai-Toronto upon calling in. I confirmed verbally with the agent 3 times. It was 2 am, and I retreated to get some sleep. Naturally when I went to use the ticket, I was informed this was not possible. However the Emirates ticketing agents informed me that the ticket could be used to fly from Dubai to Middle East destinations such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan and then chuckled. I have spent multiple hours on the phone with Emirates agents trying to sort out the problem, and the service has ranged from excellent and understanding (thank you Connor in Manchester), to rude and gleeful at pulling a bit of a hoax on a customer. Ultimately Emirates refused to honour the guarantees made by the agent (in spite of conducting an investigation which did not result in findings that contradicted my statements), because their agent was a DNATA representative. In short, you cannot trust the folks standing under the Emirates sign at the check-in in Dubai, because Emirates itself will not back their guarantees. I am extremely disappointed, and have started flying Qatar Airways instead. "
282,November 2019,Dubai to London,Business,V Beale,9th December 2019,1,A380,1,3,2,4,4,Economy Class,2,na,Trip Verified,approach to ignoring the delay," Dubai to London. Emirates has to follow international standards. We were delayed for 45 minutes. Not a single explanation or word of apology was given by the captain. This is unacceptable. We arrived in London 22 minutes late and not a word of comment. Just ""It's a nice sunny morning in London."" This approach to ignoring the delay is absurd. Do they think if they say nothing, the problem doesn't exist. Emirates has to learn how to be punctual or learn how to apologise for delays."

This flight seemed to have issues right from the start. The Boarding gate where we were to board had several leaks so we had to try and huddle in the dry sections. There was not enough seating. Boarding was chaotic at best and anyone willing to lie about their Emirates membership got in first. The lady at the door was unable to cope. The cabin was dirty, the crew seemed to not know each other, 2 rows at the back in Economy were kept empty for the use of crew (at the cost of paying passengers and despite having a section for crew to rest and sleep) which despite my request they refused to relinquish. Rest of the passengers had to make do without the 6 extra seats. Apparently this is a regular reservation for the crew on this flight. I paid 350 Dirhams for a horrible seat with legroom only for my right leg. Photo attached. Crew shouted to each other about running out of meals, one crew member scolded the other members and paid very little attention to the general public. There was one apparently senior staff who did a royal walk through the cabin and only spoke to 3 or 4 people whom she chose, I am guessing at random. Lastly they took away blankets an hour before landing and then piled them into bags. So again customer was last. It was cold and we were still an hour away. All in all I would not recommend Emirates to anyone. Please avoid this airline until they improve and take their customers seriously. I have traveled by Emirates Business class in the past and the service was excellent."

Their response to comments/complains is very very slow, takes them days to reply the issue. It is not my first time flying with Emirates, I was very pleased and liked it, I recommended it to my families and friends but this time was so disappointed.  There are 2 weights at the gate. The staff asked me to put my luggage on the weight. They said my luggage was too heavy, they fined me. Of course, it was reasonable to be fined if someone's luggage is over weight, and even though my luggage was over weight, they talked to me in a very rude way. They weight passengers selectively, I saw some people carried more and bigger bags than me, they didn't ask them to weigh their luggage."

How can the cabin crew chit chat in the galley with the curtains closed while the toilets at the back of the plane are in a dreadful condition. Really dirty and unusable. The lazy attitude of the staff in relation to maintaining the cleanliness of the washrooms also appears in their attitude to being called for service. I had to really struggle to get a simple cup of tea from them. It seems like they don't realize they are there to work and provide a service for passengers.

This is our first flying with a Emirates and I would say this is one of the worse airlines I have been. Traveling as a family of four with two you g children; we were told That we will be seated together. To our dismay our seats were separated. We were seated at the window and aisle with a stranger in between. When we raised our concerns, the staff just gave us a shrug and said that we could speak to the person and asked if they would like to change exchange their seats so at least both my kids could be seated with me. Every other airlines would be more than happy to help us in rearranging the seating arrangements and will be the ones doing the asking. However, Emirates staff were just too busy gossiping in the galley to care much about the comfort of their passengers."

The service is very poor and some cabin crew can appear disinterested. I previously used Ethiopian Airlines which has excellent service levels and was expecting similar service and better from Emirates and was sorely disappointed. The fleet used in intra-Africa flights (between Lusaka and Dubai in my case) have tiny seats and I was squashed and worried for my safety as I was in a row of three with a very large guy in the middle and I couldn't rest comfortably and was worried about getting injured. I'm used to old fleets used for intra-africa flights but Emirate seats are the smallest I've experienced. It was the worst flight ever. The cabin crew can miss rows when serving meals or drinks and it's just an annoying service. Although my flight from Dubai to London was on a new fleet with comfortable chairs what didn't change was cabin crew service which was still poor. The food is also average. I expected so much and had high hopes and was very disappointed. All style with no substance. Ethiopian Airways is better service but just shame that transit times at Bola international are so long and you can't always check-in online!

Excellent check in at DXB,  separated from Economy class passengers.  Business lounge in DXB has really poor offers for breakfast. Disappointed. Boarding not great. Business class passengers have to give priority to economy class. Strongly recommend Emirates to change policy. I felt the seat is narrow (2x3x2 seating in business class). No such experiences with CX, SQ, LH, BA or SK. Extensive film and CD selection, but the info and guidance (for choosing films) in the paper Magazine were irrelevant. Hence, ended up listening to Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Strongly recommend Emirates to present the films in a better way. For lunch there was a selection and obviously made I the wrong choice. Cannot blame Emirates but other passengers are recommended to make safer bets."

My husband and I use Emirates twice a year to fly to Dubai because it’s direct with good times and have done for many years. Sadly we have found that the last few trips the service is lacking. Yes you are greeted on arrival but that is as far as the service goes. From getting a hot towel and nuts before take off to getting a menu and scowl. On this return trip after the meal was served the drinks trolley was coming up the aisle, then the stewardess stopped three rows ahead of us and wheeled past and never returned. I do feel that rather than standing gossiping with each other in the galley the stewards/stewardesses should be going round their section making sure their passengers are ok and not waiting to be summoned. The food is really not as good now either. Always curry, which is fine now and again but not all the time. The coffee is weak and horrible too. Lots of corners being cut but prices going up. Also the rewards scheme is a joke as we will never have enough to save to make proper use of them. As I mentioned the only reason we like using this airline is the good flight times and they are direct but we are considering flying with BA in future."

The flight from Heathrow to Dubai was awesome. When I was boarding from Dubai they weighed my hand luggage again and asked to pay for my Duty-free shopping which is 4 kilos. I said this is my sweater and chocolate which I bought duty-free. They said we can consider 1-kilo rest you have to pay for it otherwise you can return your duty-free shopping. Moreover, you have only 15 minutes on your hand. If you can’t come back you will miss your flight. I tried to explain, I’m from London and always fly on Emirates it’s only 4 kg extra which is duty-free. I already weighed from London. Then they became so rude and gave me options pay for 3 Kg or throw away your products. I paid AES 240 which is around £50. Their bad customer service is enough to spoil a holiday."

Emirates normally provides excellent service, yet one weak link staff member could damage the airline’s image. Although, gold customers, we entered, from the business lounge to upper deck holding economy tickets, owing to Gate boarding directions. The boarding staff was unwelcoming, rude and arrogant, over what he wrongly perceived was our error, not Emirates’ operations. Worse still. Indicating clear distress, from my recent spine injection, he said “that doesn’t matter”. Leaving me to carry me, with no assistance from aircraft staff, to change levels. Once seated, we could hear the clunks from others changing levels, so we were not alone.  My wife and I were considering upgrading at the service desk. It was unattended and the flight was late and no alternative access appeared to an economy gate was closed or not properly indicated. Miserable staff member, this flight only. "

During the flight from Athens to the Kolkata Emirates damaged my suitcase.  Right when I collected my suitcase from the airport baggage collection conveyor I noticed this and brought to the attention to Emirates staff.  I had to wait approximately 90 min for someone from Emirates to fill out appropriate forms, copy my boarding pass and passport. Then Emirates told me that someone will get back to me within 24 hours. They called me after 3 days and asked for the receipt of the bag. I emailed them the receipt promptly the same day. Then Emirates staff said, Emirates will process my request and will contact me after a few days. Then after a couple of weeks, they contacted and asked to get back the damaged bag in order to send me the compensation. I was away from Kolkata and told them that I am away from Kolkata and it will be tough for me to go to Kolkata airport to give the bag, what if they collect it from me after I go back to the USA. They said okay. After coming back I contacted Emirates via phone and the customer service responded with the utmost courtesy and apologized every time for the delay and promised that someone will get back to me within 24 hours. Emirates never got back to me. I wrote several emails to emirates customer service with incident # and reference #, not a single response I ever received. It is a nightmare. Just a terrible service."

Emirates are mis selling these flights. The Kathmandu to Dubai leg is with FlyDubai, their budget airline. No mention is made of this when booking the tickets. The flight between Dubai and Gatwick was great as you would expect and the FlyDubai was fine for a budget airline BUT I didnt realise I was booking a budget airline. It's in a totally different terminal with minimal facilities and you need to allow 1 hour to transfer. If I was only travelling between Dubai and Kathmandu fine but I had a 5 hour wait in a sparse terminal after an overnight flight. Then was on a budget flight, no offer of even water until we were 1 hour into the flight. No problem with budget airlines if its what I choose but I and everyone I spoke to about the second flight felt we'd been tricked by Emirates."
300,November 2019,Newark  to Athens,Couple Leisure,F Mita,5th November 2019,1,na,1,1,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,I was now late for my flight," Newark to Athens. This has been my worst flying experience.  I received an email to check into my flight from Newark to Athens, which I did hours before my flight. Due to a glitch in the system, the app failed to provide me with a digital boarding pass but confirmed that I was checked in. I figured that I would print my boarding pass when I got to the airport so I didn’t worry too much about it. Upon reaching the airport I go to the clerk to print my boarding pass and she tells me that I am not checked in. I show her the confirmation in my phone from their app confirming that I am checked in and for whatever reason she cannot seem to find me in their system. So I ask her where's the kiosk so that I can quickly check myself and come to find out, Newark airport has no Emirates kiosk and the lines are flooded with passengers? I tried my hardest to inform the Emirates representative at the desk that I was indeed checked in but she informs me that because she doesn’t see me in their system I cannot board the plane. So I pleaded with the woman to tell me what I needed to do to get checked in and she told me that the only way to check in is to do it through their app. I asked if I could speak to a manager or call Emirates, and the rep tells me that there is no time because the plane is about to take off. So even though I arrived in time for my flight, I was now late for my flight, and I was unable to board. I call Emirates and I was informed that I would have to purchase new tickets  or just pay a no show fee which is $400 per person plus additional fees. Which came out to $850 per person. Which actually added up to just purchasing new tickets. The thing is I not only had more than one hotel booked but I also had a connecting flight that I would also inevitably miss a well as other arrangements so I lost time, money, and had to spend more money to purchase two new tickets, also two more plane tickets when i reached Athens to finish my travel. At this point I'm infuriated and disgusted because I do not live by Newark airport, I live 1hr and 20 mins away, so not only did I miss my flights including a whole nights stay at some of my hotels, and my flight from Athens, I was stranded at this airport.
