1,November 2022,Vancouver to Delhi,Couple Leisure,Harjit Dhaliwal,5th November 2022,2,na,1,1,3,1,4,Economy Class,1,1,Not Verified,Very poor service, Very poor service. Food was pathetic with no variation for lunch or dinner. No water or drink or snacks. Most Tvs / entertainment systems not working. No blankets. Staff not visible and not responding to calls.
2,November 2022,Mumbai to Kolkata,Solo Leisure,V Atwal,5th November 2022,7,A320 Neo,5,5,5,na,5,Economy Class,5,na,Trip Verified,great value for money ,"I had found this fare which came at a discount and thought of considering it. The check in was done properly and the last time I travelled on the airline post the Tata takeover, they had reduced the meal service so was skeptical over what the meal service was going to be like on this flight because the last time I travelled, only a sandwich as provided. The boarding started on time however the pushback got delayed by 30 mins due to the congestion at Mumbai airport which is the norm. I was also pleased to note that the ground staff offered me an extra legroom seat which was greatly appreciated. For the breakfast service I was pleasantly surprised as they were offering full breakfasts with both vegetarian as well as non vegetarian fares whereas previously only vegetarian was offered. The cutleries stainless steel instead of plastic which was a great touch. For the vegetarian fayre, it consisted of idlis, poha, croissant as well as mango yogurt along with tea / coffee which was great. The arrival was delayed by 30 minutes. But overall this was great value for money as I had got an extra legroom seat, a full breakfast with steel cutleries and good staff and crew service. I will be flying the return leg soon and I'm confident of receiving similar service. So much appreciated."

5,November 2022,Chennai to Dubai,Business,Ramapati Singhania,4th November 2022,8,na,5,4,5,na,2,Business Class,5,na,Trip Verified,ticket was cheaper by 40%, My flight Dubai - Chennai was very comfortable in seat 2D. Of course the plane was very old. The safety announcements were antiquated. Entertainment systems were absent. And the seats had limited reclining. But the ticket was cheaper by 40% so I was happy to accept these shortcomings. And the plane was on time.  The 2 lady flight attendants were very attentive and empathetic. I had ordered a gluten free meal and they made sure I was comfortable with it. 
6,June 2022,Chicago to New Delhi,Family Leisure,Agnes Chadi,1st November 2022,1,na,1,2,1,1,2,Economy Class,2,1,Not Verified,do not care for their customers, I took air india in December 2021 and June 2022. On my return I wanted to claim the milage. Something went wrong and I couldn't access the flying return milage program. For last 5 months I have contacted air india staff in vain. Tons of back and forth emails and number of calls at customer service number. They keep passing me from person to person and asking for same document multiple times. I am fed up and frustrated following up with the AI staff and come to conclusion that they have a bunch of staff who do not care for their customers. One of the poorest customer service of an international company. What a pity. Be careful if you ever want to take Air India. There are options people and we deserve a better deal.
7,October 2022,Mumbai to Newark,Solo Leisure,Mary Jones,25th October 2022,1,Boeing 777,2,1,1,1,1,Business Class,1,1,Trip Verified,seats were very uncomfortable," A very old aircraft. I got moved twice because the seat buttons were not working. The seats were very uncomfortable. The tv screen was hazy and unclear. Entertainment was limited to 5 English movies! The map route was not available and the vegetarian breakfast was disgusting. No flavor. The captain came on the speakers twice, at departure and arrival. Most announce the altitude and give a few details of how the route will be."
8,October 2022,Delhi to Vancouver,Solo Leisure,Lalita Basra,24th October 2022,1,na,2,2,1,1,2,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,Airport staff is not trained well, Airport staff is not trained well. Everyone was giving me the different information. Do not know what is the next step. Taking hours for work should be done within minutes. Took double the amount of fee for one baggage. Trying to contact customer service and agents are saying they cannot do anything and I should speak to Delhi airport wow is that even possible. What are they working for?

Don’t fly Air India."
11,September 2022,London to Delhi,Business,J Basan,19th October 2022,2,A380,3,1,2,1,1,Business Class,2,na,Trip Verified,very poor experience," Overall very poor experience. Only highlight was access to lounge at HTR airport which was Singapore Airlines lounge. Flight experience - seats are not as comfortable as one would expect in business class. Very old seats with poor cushion. seats in row 1 is very narrow. Flight entertainment did not work so made the flight very noisy. Food was not up to business class standard. Did not get wash bag when flying out, not sure why. Flight from Delhi to London - food was very poor. A menu was supplied only to be told that options on the menu not available. Food tasted poor quality and dry. Airport lounge at Delhi airport was not up to standard - food was limited choice, not enough provisions. I would give a zero rating for inflight entertainment and food if I had a choice."

The quality of food has improved and the variety introduced is amazing. In fact this particular route which I flew, i reached before time. Strongly recommend"

Turned out to be a pretty smooth and comfortable flight. Quick & efficient check-in staff. Plane arrived early, we departed early and reach much before the scheduled arrival time. The cabin crew was courteous and professional. Snacks served were very basic but of good quality. Emphasis was made on covid safety protocols. Baggage reclaim was quick. Though the aircraft was 12.6 years old and did show some signs of ageing, the cabin was quite clean and in a good condition despite the years of wear. "
18,September 2022,Sydney to Delhi,Couple Leisure,Reena Makkar,29th September 2022,8,na,5,5,5,5,5,Business Class,5,na,Trip Verified,a great experience for us2," Both me and my husband travelled in business class on the 25th September. The flight was very comfortable. The air hostesses went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. We were provide with amenities including a night suit. The food was more than sufficient and extremely tasty. I will like to specially mention the cabin supervisor Kalpana and her team members Varsha, Preeti and Makarand. I have come across a lot of negative comments about Air India but honestly it was a great experience for us."
19,September 2022,Bangalore to London,Family Leisure,Nikhil Jasrotia,28th September 2022,4,na,4,1,4,1,3,Economy Class,2,1,Trip Verified,Outdated aircraft," Outdated aircraft. The entertainment system's screen could barely be seen. A very laggy interface. (This was on either legs of the flight. BLR-MUM-LHR & the return leg) The company needs to immediately look to upgrade their high traffic/revenue routes for start. Selection of alcohol was pathetic. They're only offering cheap IMFL liquor Sula wine & Blenders Pride. Ballentine though part of selection, was over shortly. Professional staff, who know how to manage the odd unruly passenger or support the elderly. If AI has anything to be thankful for, it is their staff."
20,September 2022,Toronto to Delhi,Couple Leisure,V Jaydel,22nd September 2022,7,na,5,4,4,2,3,Business Class,4,na,Trip Verified,Will travel again," Service was very good. Some minor problems but bearable as the price was close 1000 usd cheaper. The arm rest falling apart, choices on TV had 7 categories but only movies and TV options were working About 4 seats were not functioning. They blocked off those seats and accommodated the passengers in other available seats Staff was very attentive. Will travel again"
21,September 2022,Delhi to Ahmedabad,Business,Rahul Anand,21st September 2022,8,A321,4,3,4,na,4,Economy Class,4,na,Trip Verified,Smooth experience," Smooth experience, early morning flight from Delhi. Aircraft was almost empty, with capacity around 200 passengers of A321 it was having only 60 passengers. Requested by cabin crew to occupy emergency exit seat to fulfil the emergency protocol.

Departed on time and so was arrival. Air India is the only domestic airline which offers 20kg baggage allowance whereas rest all offers 15kg. Seat pitch of Air India is better than any other domestic airline. Cabin was clean and fresh but due to mishandling and mismanagement by previous management the seats are bit old, new management needs to refurbish now. Served good breakfast on the way, Staff were courteous and good service on board."
23,September 2022,New York JFK to Cochin via Delhi,Family Leisure,Jyoti Nair,20th September 2022,1,na,2,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,We had the worst experience, We had the worst experience flying with Air India. I was flying with my 12 year old son and I had hurt my knee and needed a wheel chair. The food was horrible on the flight. Tasteless food and our television set was not working. We were traveling 14 hours without a TV. The crew tried their level best to reset it but it just would not work. The ground staff at Delhi Airport was just horrible. They have a huge badge that says no tips but since he has to help me from international to Domestic and take my luggage from I decided I would pay him 1000 Rupees which I thought was a fair tip. But he started demanding more money and n dollars. His friends came there too asking what’s the matter.  He told me that he took me their short cuts so he has to share the money thru the official thru. Wow Air India. Your officers don’t get paid that they loot us? Finally he settled for 60$. Why when all other air line employee or for that matter Air India ground staff in the USA won’t demand money why in India do they literally take advantage of you? Shameless.
24,September 2022,Bengaluru to Dubai,Family Leisure,Vivek Anand,20th September 2022,8,A320 NEO,5,5,4,na,4,Economy Class,4,na,Trip Verified,The airline has improved," The airline has improved in terms of great customer service, a courteous cabin crew, and excellent food and beverages served.

25,September 2022,Melbourne to Delhi,Family Leisure,R Hasin,19th September 2022,3,Boeing 787,2,1,2,2,1,Economy Class,2,1,Trip Verified,aircraft seats were torn and dirty," We flew economy to Delhi from Melbourne on Air India AI309 on 16 Sept 2022 in a Boeing 787-8. At check-in the staff wanted our vaccine certificate and Airseva app downloaded. This was not known whilst booking or was any email sent prior to the day of departure. This resulted in huge chaos at check-in as lot many didn’t know. The aircraft seats were torn, and dirty, and the handrest and other parts of the seat were held together with fraying masking tape. The cabin partitions and carpet were covered with grime. The flexible arm of the display wouldn’t stand up, and the wired remote was broken and temperamental. The Upma & Vada served for breakfast was undercooked and stale. The bread roll was cold and tough as a rubber pad. Food didn't get any better on the 12-hour flight. Snacks were meagre to non-existent. I have used public urinals, which are cleaner than the toilets on board. The in flight service and cleanliness on this route were much better before the change of ownership."
26,September 2022,Delhi to Madurai via Chennai,Couple Leisure,Vamshi Krishnan,18th September 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Not Verified,supposedly too late for boarding," I have been a frequent flier in Air India being a government employee, took a sigh of relief when it got privatised, which meant that I no longer had the compulsion to fly the same. However, against my better judgement I booked a flight from Delhi - Madurai via Chennai on 18 Sep. Reached the airport about an hr and thirty mins early as I was already travelling from Jammu. But due to the overall rush at the entrance and que, reached the counter 55 MINS prior to departure, but to my horror I was refused a ticket as the ‘Wonderful Server of Air India’ didn’t take web checkin and I was supposedly too late for boarding. The same was the case with four more passengers on same flight and even on the request of so many passengers, no body triers to hear the problem or help. the Manager was rude to the hapless passengers."
27,July 2022,Delhi to Kerala,Family Leisure,Advay Biswal,15th September 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Not Verified,won't fly Air India again," The worst airline I have ever experienced. The ground staff is very rude. And most of the time the In Flight Entertainment doesn't work. The call button in the flight doesn't work, it took me 20 minutes to call a flight attendant. The food is horrible. The seats are very unhygienic, the tray table is also very dirty. After arriving on the airport, it took 30 minutes just for the first bag to come, and when I received mine, it was a bit damaged from the side. Terrible airline, won't fly Air India again."
28,September 2022,Bengaluru to Mumbai,Solo Leisure,N Shavun,8th September 2022,6,A320 neo,5,2,5,na,5,Economy Class,5,na,Trip Verified,new ownership is interested in cutting costs," The fare was booked at a cheaper fare which was good. The check in process and the ground staff was also good. The boarding started on time. However my experience related to the food and catering has been the opposite. Seems Air India has dropped the ball with regards to the food on board. Previously before it got privatized, they used to provide a full breakfast with tea / coffee as part of it's morning service. This time when I traveled post the takeover, instead of the breakfast, all we got was a sandwich. No beverages at all. Air India's food and catering was always it's strong point even before it got privatized (along with seat pitch and baggage allowance). But it seems that the new ownership is interested in cutting costs and then marketing this as as some sort of ""innovation"" to the gullible flying public. There are so many other aspects of the airline that need to be improved. Instead what the owners have done is turned a strength into a weakness."
29,June 2022,Vancouver to Delhi,Solo Leisure,Jen Thomas,7th September 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Not Verified,Worst flight I ever had," Worst flight I ever had. I paid money and they even did not provide basic needs. TV was there and it wasn't working, and you can understand how I feel that for a long flight. I asked cabin crews for few things and honestly speaking, restaurant staffs are way more better than them. They were too rude and I became really scared to ask even for a glass of water. Guys, please, we are spending too much money on this airline atleast provide what we deserve. Please do train your staff, please make sure things are working, it is a request."
30,August 2022,Delhi to Ahmedabad,Family Leisure,Hussain Lokhandwala,30th August 2022,3,A321,3,na,4,na,2,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,Leg space was also very small, They are providing TV but not allowing to use us. In Air india on same day I was travelling in 2 flights in both meals were included but in both they gave us the same meal in which they gave sandwich with a water bottle. This sandwich taste is very bad we ask them to give another food for which we were ready to pay but they had no other options. Leg space was also very small. There were no wifi connection.
31,January 2022,Toronto to Delhi,Family Leisure,Harjinder Bamrah,29th August 2022,1,na,2,2,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Not Verified,Totally poor service, I travelled in January 2022 from Toronto to New Delhi.

32,August 2022,Vancouver to Delhi,Solo Leisure,Sahil Malhotra,29th August 2022,1,Boeing 777-300ER,3,1,1,1,1,Business Class,2,1,Trip Verified, My seat stopped reclining," Rock hard seats (even in business), infotainment system worked thankfully, but the movies collection was very limited and from pre 2000 era. The interface was dated and buggy. Food quantity was limited with very poor presentation. I had an onward journey of 2 hours with Vistara on a domestic business, and that food quality/presentation was far better than this 14 hr Air India flight. Typical other issues as expected/noted with this flight. Seats were dirty, and you could see adhesive in various places. My seat stopped reclining mid-way and got stuck in a lie-flat position; I was then moved to another seat, which did not recline at all, and I was forced to be in a sitting position for the remainder journey. The washroom sink was choked towards the latter half of the flight. Feedback/complaint registered on Air India website, but as expected, there is no response (been over 15 days). The only positive of the airline was the cabin crew, who were courteous and polite. Flying economy of AC or one of the ME3 is a better choice than flying business with Air India!"
33,August 2022,Chennai to San Francisco via New Delhi,Solo Leisure,Sridhar Makkena,26th August 2022,4,na,4,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Not Verified,I decided to not fly Air India again," I was flying from New Delhi to San Francisco. The food was horrible. The chicken was bone dry,  green beans were raw at the center, the dish was very watery. The rice I was served was very dry and hard, the curry lacking any flavor. The seats didn't recline properly, and were as hard as a rock. The cabin crew was helpful, but unfortunately that's about as far as the positives go. I decided to not fly Air India again."
34,August 2022,Delhi to Paris,Family Leisure,Alpa Gandhi,25th August 2022,3,Boeing 787-8,2,2,3,1,2,Economy Class,2,na,Trip Verified,Air India will certainly be my last option, Extremely disappointed with in flight entertainment. Mine did not work at all and getting through the long flight was a nightmare. The steward clearly told me that they cannot check each every unit and it is just my bad luck! I am already dreading my return flight after 15 days. Will Air India stay on my list of preferred airlines? Answer is no. Air India will certainly be my last option. Also. one of my bags also came back damaged!
35,June 2022,Newark to Indore via Delhi,Family Leisure,Akhilesh Joshi,24th August 2022,1,Boeing 777-300ER / A321,1,1,1,1,2,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,not cleaned since many of the past flights," I travelled from Newark to Delhi on 27 Jun 2022. Welcome onboard by air hostesses was like as they are obliging me by allowing to board the flight. The seat was not fully operational with Digital screen. The handle/bar swivel was not aligned properly. Retractable desk was broken and screws missing and the hinges were with ‘wet’ adhesive. It appeared that they were either just pasted or wrong adhesive was used to stick the broken hinges/ swivel.  When opened the table, I was continuous holding the glass and water bottle, as it was not balanced, they were rolling towards centre. ( No turbulence). There was no connection to plug in the ear phone and the socket was missing. (I picked up ear phone from adjoining vacant seat). International flight of 14 hrs was not provided with sanitizer, face mask, eye mask, dental kit, shaving kit except the dirty throw blanket and pillow.  The newspaper shelves/ behind the front seat were too dirty and full of garbage.  The bulkheads had so many oily spots/ finger spots that they were not cleaned since many of the past flights.  Regarding welcome drinks there was no option other than Orange/ Apple juice or aerated water/ drinks and soda drinks. 1The digital screen had only 6 (classical) and 4 (recent) movies out of which few could not be screened. The map was continuous on “Flight Data not available”. Lunch was just like ‘Rice Plate’ available in Mumbai worth Rs 20/-. The cheapest desert, dried bun, no fruits. The quantity was 4 cubes of Paneer, four pieces of boiled potato and 2-3 spoons of boiled rice.  After serving lunch, the staff did not serve drinks/ water for almost eight hours of flight. Later on approaching to pantry, the staff denied rather expressed their binding to serve on seat.  After nine hours they distribute dry snack pacjets(3) 20gms each without tea/ coffee/drinks or fluid. The overhead lights were on auto mode to switch ON / OFF and the attendance call switches were not working.  The toilets were filthy with no hand soap/ cologne etc. only hand sanitizer of local brand was kept with scarcity of hand tissues.  The second meal was served 2:00 hrs before the destination which contained 4 spoon rice, beans and boiled yellow dal + yogurt and mango pudding as desert. The cutlery items were from the cheapest plastic product and a tissue paper of 4x6 size, that too of the cheapest quality. It’s a disgrace for me to travel with Air India on a premium category international flight.  The hot tea/coffee was served in paper cups of roadside quality which can be bought in market for Rs 25- 100 pieces. "

37,August 2022,Bhubaneshwar to Ahmedabad via Mumbai,Couple Leisure,Rahul Anand,20th August 2022,8,A320,4,4,5,na,4,Economy Class,4,na,Trip Verified,Staff were courteous," Bhubaneshwar to Ahmedabad via Mumbai. Both aircraft used was A320. Staff were courteous, as it was snack time so only a sandwich with a sweet were provided, same for Mumbai Ahmedabad flight as it was less than an hour flight. At Bhubaneshwar after boarding there were some security reasons (and it was independence day of India) we were deboarded and again have to go through security and also through check of aircraft, this made the schedule delayed and we were on the verge of missing our connecting flight, we contacted commercial staff and they assured that they will try our best to get the connection. When we reached Mumbai it was already boarding time of our connection, just after disembarking we saw a staff who was waiting for us , he escorted till security, before security he changed our (only) boarding pass with a new one which was printed on business class so that we can go through business class security which was like a breeze. Actually we were the last one to board and they were waiting for us only."
38,August 2022,London to Hyderabad,Family Leisure,D Vargalli,19th August 2022,4,na,3,5,3,3,1,Economy Class,3,na,Trip Verified,Very disappointed with Air India, They didn’t give us seat belt for the Infant we are travelling with which is really not safe and there is only 1 cot seat for the whole economy class. It is very difficult to travel with infant on lap for 10 hrs. Very disappointed with Air India.
39,August 2022,Mumbai to Male,Couple Leisure,R Marbini,18th August 2022,8,na,4,5,4,na,3,Economy Class,5,na,Trip Verified,I would recommend," As with other Indian companies, we had problems with the web check-in, but the check-in was smooth (it was Independence day, and almost no one was flying). Everything else was fine. The cabin service was great, and the personnel nice. The price is that of a low cost with, but the service is much better. I would recommend."
40,July 2022,London to Trivandrum via Delhi,Family Leisure,D Baji,17th August 2022,1,na,3,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Not Verified,It was a nightmare for us," The flight was old and everything in it showed ageing. The plastics were cracked, upholstery stained, cushions rock solid, paint peeling. The entertainment screen was not working and when asked the air hostess replied that it’s complaint in almost half of the flight. This happened on our way to and back. This is the first time we are travelling in Air India. In air India even on a £800 ticket (there were 6 of us including a 2yr old, so £4800 in total) you feel poor and wants to get out of it as soon as possible. There were not even a colour pencil to entertain a 2yr old, I shouldn’t be complaining about that, should be glad we even got a seat (not comfortable though) to sit for 8hrs. The food was heavily salted and tasted cheap.  The flights were not on time (affected the transit time, so we had to run from one flight to next) but I not as bad as I heard before, at least Tata taking over has done some good. London via Delhi is not a good idea. When you come from London you need to check out and check in your luggage at Delhi again, so that takes min 2hrs in transit time (not to mention the porters and staff at Delhi trying to scam you) and you will almost miss your next flight of the first one was late to arrive in Delhi. It was a nightmare for us, especially travelling with a child. What an embarrassment to Indians!"

The plane from Mumbai to Newark was dilapidated and some of the seats were even broken (they were still assigned to customers). The in-flight entertainment did not work. The flight attendants seemed apathetic to pressing the request assistance button on the seats. The food was just OK. We had terrible experience checking in at the Mumbai airport. The airport manager was rude and would not let me check in my car seat for free which is the law in the US and demanded me to pay extra money for it. He would not listen to my argument that I got it to India for free and this was my return trip back to the US. Only later I showed him that the Air India website listed that car seats travel free that he allowed me to check the car seats for free. I would not recommend this airline to anyone till Air India retrains their staff in customer service and upgrades their airplanes.

Their domestic aircrafts are in much better shape. There was a 8 hour delay to begin with. Paid additional price for booking XL seats for extra leg space but to my horror realized that these seats are narrower at the waist in comparison to a normal seat. Broken tray tables with cracks and stains, no inflight entertainment (for the entire duration of the journey) and a nonworking toilet added to our woes. Would the top management of AI fly economy on such an aircraft on a 14 hour flight? The cabin crew were courteous but there was nothing much they could do with regards to the condition of the aircraft."

Air con did not work for 45 minutes when we were waiting to take off at 40C in Delhi airport (it worked fine once we were airborne), seats did not recline properly.

Also the airhostess were very rude. I booked business class tickets. The seats were completely uncomfortable. I had requested for 1 extra blanket for my back and they refused. The staff member said 1 person will get only one and the staff were using 3 blankets to sleep on the seats. Also they had curtains closed in the middle row. The staff occupied all the seats in the middle row to sleep.  How can the staff sleep in customer area. Business class facilities the staff were using. There is no difference in treatment of economy passengers and business class passengers. Its waste of money. Also one my luggage they had lost and it was international departure. When I claimed I didn’t get any compensation. They are rude and worst airline. The staff is very unprofessional. 
56,June 2022,Sydney to Paris via Delhi,Solo Leisure,D Meares,9th July 2022,2,Boeing 787,3,2,1,1,3,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,It was a horror show," Thinking of an Air India flight with long stopover in Delhi? It was a horror show. Yes a 19hr stop allows for multi-hour delays (ours was 4.75 late leaving Sydney so they boarded us just before they'd have to give compensation, to sit there) If you book a hotel and organise a transit e-visa for those hours their bureaucracy will likely have a complete meltdown. The transit official confiscated my next boarding pass. (I had to argue to retrieve my bag tag, which was a good thing as I suddenly noticed my bag hadn’t been transferred as promised). The delay meant I'd missed the last train, then I couldn’t get back into the terminal till a few hours before departure without the boarding pass. Then the bureaucracy to get a new boarding pass was Kafkaesque since I was already checked in. No infection control wipes on the plane, 2 special meals didn’t arrive, entertainment on one side of the 1st plane was broken, the air filter on the 2nd chockablock plane looked disgusting; and clueless checkin agents were too busy insisting on printouts of things like 2nd vaccination shots (though I had printouts confirming my 3rd) to tell you that unusual items like drone cameras will be confiscated from your hand luggage during the transit x-ray. No other airlines have this policy, and mine was summarily confiscated in Delhi ""you can't take things that fly on the aeroplane"" — seriously; that was their rationale! Nice flight attendants Sydney to Delhi though & 33” legroom was the only redeeming feature. Lastly, unforgivably, I discovered they fly right over the Russian war zone that other airlines avoid, whilst using Russian oil bought cheaply by India sidestepping embargos. French airport staff were so incensed at this that they gave the plane the very last aerobridge and the very furthermost baggage carousel from that, a punishing 30 minute walk between. So your legs pay a price in addition to your conscience."
57,July 2022,Delhi to Singapore,Solo Leisure,E Han,9th July 2022,7,na,2,5,3,4,3,Economy Class,5,5,Trip Verified,I am severely disappointed," I had a window seat, and the person in the middle seat next to me had a broken screen. Nothing was done, so I just told him that I would watch a movie and let him use my screen after my movie. Midway through the flight, I was really cold, and it took me 20 minutes to call the attention of the flight attendants. The call button was not working, so I tried flashing my light from my cell phone, but nobody was minding me. Eventually, the person in the aisle seat in the same row took the initiative to inform the cabin crew to give me a blanket. Unfortunately, all blankets had already run out. The good news is that the person next to me shared his blanket with me. Also, after being served peanuts, the captain made an announcement that all passengers had to put their masks back on; however, the cabin crew was not implementing this. I have had a terrible sore throat for over a week now. I just wish Air India would take the health and comfort of the customers more seriously. In addition to this, my seat and table were not exactly very clean (see attached photos). As a Star Alliance Member, I am severely disappointed."

The mould lining the windows and the seats was unhygienic enough but the movies screen were cracked and unusable .. only very few worked and when they did they were extremely difficult to operate. We received 1 water over a 12 hour flight and the food they provided us with was mid. Flew with both my parents and a friend of mine and we requested seats together, well at least for my friend and I because we're nervous on planes. They were unable to do that for us and we all sat in completely different seats ... when we made a complaint and tried to switch seats they kept dismissing us.

60,June 2022,London to Delhi,Business,A Kajay,5th July 2022,1,na,5,3,3,1,3,Business Class,3,2,Trip Verified,relates to my lost luggage," Onboard the flights i have found several times their screens do not work, this also applies in Business Class. One might think its a fault so they'll ignore it or maybe only that particular aircraft has the issue but sadly not. I have found this issue continuously. My negative review with Air India really relates to my lost luggage. There are no words to explain the misery i went through with Air India in trying to retrieve my bag. At Heathrow I was given a P.I.R (Property Regularity Report and a ""authority to claim delayed baggage"" form which i filled in. Alongside this I was told my bag would be back within 3-5 days and was given a online tracking link. In this luggage i had items that could never be retrieved back for example wedding photos dating back over 100 years of my great grandparents, this is just one example. I wrote several emails to Air India and although i had responses none of them answered my question. All responses were exactly the same (standard) giving me different links. Furthermore i made several calls to them to which none were answered. After 6 days the online tracking stated the bag was found and loaded onto a Air India flight back to Heathrow. The bag never arrived. I only came to know this by ringing in so many times and not just one day but over several days - basically my mornings were wasted This happened four times. It is only when i built up a decent relationship at Heathrow with the person dealing with delayed baggage to send a strong email internally. I called everyday probably more than 50 times and be lucky if my call was answered. When the bag eventually arrived after 15 days i requested that i will collect it - a travel distance of 120 miles from where i live to Heathrow. I got to Heathrow (to get in to the baggage area is another story) and opened up my bag to find many things missing.  Thankfully some of the missing items were located (thanks to the gentleman at Heathrow who understood my situation) at Delhi airport. They advised they wouldn't post it and someone had to collect it. With the connections i have there i was able to retrieve majority of my items, however without the connections i would have had to travel to Delhi and no doubt would have been harassed. In my opinion Air India has the potential of becoming a superior airline but the mentality of certain staff members who handle luggage really lets the airline down. I have seen more negative reviews for Air India than positive ones and its about time that i wake up and don't ignore them but rather take them on board."

Air India is the worst airline and a big shame to our country. Their staff members are rude and unprofessional. After flight booking I found first name and initials are jumbled up in the ticket, so I called customer support but its hours long wait time, then I tried US number which was picked up by a rude person who couldn't communicate in English or Hindi either, there was no resolution over the call. Before take-off safety demo was not performed which is mandatory as per aviation laws, cabin announcements were made in a very feeble tone that no one was able to understand. Landing was very hard on touchdown. After landing our luggage was not present on announced baggage belt, hence we checked with Air India ground staff but instead of helping that person responded rudely that he is not concerned with anyone's luggage and we should find our missing bags ourselves over the airport. The airline was managed by Indian government earlier, as usual govt employees have no interest in doing work, rather they prefer to get free salaries as govt jobs are secure by default, hence the entire crew is affected by this laziness disease. Hope a positive change would come in future."

First thing first was at baggage register counter was full with a lot of peoples because at the same G counter there was not just Paris flight register counter it was with Paris, New York , Toronto flight baggage counter . So there was a lot of rush it took us 2 hours to register our bags. And when we reach at counter the lady took almost 30 minutes to print our boarding passes . Then it took us 1 hours to complete the immigration process. We asked Air India employee to help us to speed up the immigration but he said we can't do anything then when we finished the security check. And ran towards our gate air India employee call us to come fast to boarding gate. We said we are coming but they did not wait for us for 5 min and can't let us in. We missed our flight. After that when i ask air India employee to help us but they were not helping us a lot.  I asked them to at least give me tickets for next flight because it was not my fault. But they said its completely your fault and we can't do anything for you. My wife was ill. she beg to your employees to at least help us in something but there was nothing from them. I asked to give us tickets for next flight but they said sir you have to pay 500€ extra for that tickets. Not a refund Not a coupon to eat something between the waiting time to get our bags. Not a single penny refunded and they are asking for 500 € We paid 500€ because we need to start our jobs. After that i asked them any help to at least a stay in hotel for waiting time but they said no we can't do anything. For me it's the first and last Air India experience. "

I was very pleasantly surprised. Perhaps having low initial expectations was part of it, perhaps it is a reflection of the privatisation of AI but I found the flights enjoyable.

72,April 2022,Newark to Vadodara via Delhi,Family Leisure,Freny Zaveri,4th May 2022,1,Boeing 777,1,1,2,1,2,Economy Class,2,1,Not Verified,only 10% of the screens started working," Before you call AI Customer service - grab tons of patience and few hours in hand to get through the whole process. You need to call AI customer service number which is not trained at all for any customer service. Not even basic greetings. The rep is talking to you and behind you hear a supervisor shouting at staff constantly. Couple of times I asked the representative if everything is ok there and lady responded that it is usual. Once you have your basic itinerary ready, they will transfer you to billing department which can take only AMEX or Visa card. They do have few other options like net banking, Indian credit cards etc. When you are ready to pay AI, representative will send you a link where you can authorize the payment - 90% of the time that doesn't work. With that link your reservation is secure for 4 hours, so you keep on trying to pay. Then I put my Credit card information and my India address which is not connected to my credit card and magic happened. My payment was accepted and here I am wondering will that be a fraud inquiry from my credit card company. Finally, after all this I had a ticket to travel. Before the flight I updated our food preferences and all the passport and global entry information. The website will save the information but when you go next time to check your information that is gone so you need to add that all over again. BTW they don’t have separate line for TSA APPROVE either on the airport. It is one common line at Newark Airport (EWR). Finally, we settled in the flight and after takeoff it was time for the first meal. The air hostess came and said there was only 1 request for a child's meal so unfortunately, we don't have an extra child's meal. I am glad my older one eats a little spicy food so I convinced her to eat a regular meal so that my younger one could eat a meal. I had reconfirmed on the website as well as on the call multiple times about our food preferences but still no luck. The flight was Boeing 777 (OLD) plane which has no Wi-Fi. Everyone gets their personal screen in front of the seat but most of them were not working. The whole flight complained so they restarted the whole system. After that only 10% of the screens started working. Now on a 14 hour long flight you don't have Wi-Fi or screen. The people who already downloaded from home are very smart. In short, have plenty of downloads so you can kill 14 hours on flight. Finally, we made it to India and felt now everything will be fine, but my misery continued while coming back from Vadodara to Newark. As we reached Vadodara airport, all looks good, easy going, all documents verified and here I am waiting at the counter to get my boarding pass so we can head to lounge. The rep is saying - Mam, all boarding pass issued for both flights except yours, so we need to issue handwritten boarding pass. Did he say had written boarding pass, I was like no one will believe this is a valid document and security won't let me pass. The AI rep is no mam, it happens sometimes, and they know. You please go ahead. As I reached to security line and handed over my boarding pass, the officer was looking at me as though I am an alien and had I issued a handwritten pass to myself. AI supposed to inform Airport security about this so I can have easy transition but knowing AI they didn't bother to inform the security. When I said firmly that it's between AI and Airport security finally AI security showed up and resolved the issue. "

Approximately an hour later they told us they found our tablet and it was in their possession there at Delhi Airport. However, they refused to give it to us as it was no longer between the hours of 9 to 5. I explained to the woman that we were flying out that evening and couldn't return in the morning as we arrived back in the states in the morning. I even asked if I could pay to have it shipped to me in the states. She said she couldn't help us and then grabbed her purse and left without telling us what to do next or how to proceed. Then once I returned to the states there was no one working the Air India counter but a very nice woman gave me a phone number to call. I called the Air India number and the customer service agent said he can’t help me and that I had to call the Delhi Service desk (the same one that wouldn’t help me when I was standing there, and this same desk that had my computer and refused to hand it to me). I told him I couldn’t afford to call Delhi and that I needed his help and he kept saying no, call the airport and then he hung up on me. We called and emailed numerous times and it has been a month and still nothing. The plane was terrible, seats had no cushions and no room. None of the TVs worked and there was no WIFI ... made for a long 17hr flight. The flight crew were rude and wouldn't let us look out the windows except at specified times even though we were flying over the Himalayas and I wanted to see them. When boarding Delhi to the States you have to go through a second security checkpoint at the gate before you board (full xray scan and everything). The machine was malfunctioning and so they made all 400 of us stand in line waiting for an hour while they figured out they had to plug it in and we took off late because of it. No communication about it at all."

We were harrased right before the boarding that diaper bag is not allowed. She could either bring her carry on or diaper bag. I showed this person from the Air India website that a personal item is allowed other than carry on such as laptop or diaper bag and threatened us that he will not let us take this flight. That was the end of discussion. Very rude staff, I will never fly with Air India again ever. Also for both inbound and outbound flights my in flight entertainment screen was broken. Imagine travelling 14 hours straight without screen."

In the meantime we asked for blanket nobody listened us. Screen was not working. I was waiting for water or some drink to take medicine they asked we will not serve in between meals you have to go at back and grab yourself. When they served meal chapati was missing, and they served snack items with major meal to save their time and energy. On the whole it was bad experience with this flight as I travelled first time with Air India so I will not recommend this flight to anybody."

I learned that the flight was rescheduled to the next day after arriving at the airport. Airport staff had no idea of timing for the flight and I wasn't even provided a boarding pass. After that I tried to call Air India constantly for eight hours and every single person kept me on hold for 30 minutes and hung up later. Terrible customer support. Next day I reached the airport early morning as I wasn't told about the time, waited for 15 hours and I was told the flight is at midnight. I was provided a boarding pass for Toronto to Delhi and no confirmation for my connecting flight from Delhi to Vadodara. I waited at Toronto airport for 20 hours and flight took off at 4am in the morning. After I reached Delhi they said we cant give you any flight as your scheduled flight departed 2 days ago. The airport staff were extremely rude and started shouting. I waited another 16 hours at Delhi airport for a connecting flight. No one was sorry, no apologies and lot of disappointment. Wasted four days of my trip and my marriage had to postpone because of terrible service from Air India. My other six friends travelled around same week and everyone was tortured like this."
79,April 2022,Washington to Delhi,Family Leisure,S Kamalaya,30th April 2022,1,Boeing 787,5,5,1,1,3,Economy Class,2,3,Trip Verified,left stranded with very little options," Our flight route was from Washington DC IAD to Bengaluru via Delhi on 27th April ‘22. The scheduled stopover was 2.5 hours in which we had to complete immigration, check out baggage , go through customs and re-check in baggage and finally do the security check before boarding the second flight to Bengaluru. There was a delay of approx 45 mins by the time the flight landed in Delhi. So we had roughly only about 1.5 hours to complete the above steps. Unfortunately, although we were able to finish all the required steps by 1:30 pm, which was the scheduled departure time, we found to our dismay at the gate that the flight had taken off. What followed after that was a very difficult situation for any international traveller. We are a family of 4 carrying 9 checkin items along with carryon items. We received very little to no guidance or help from the airline officials. We were exited out of the airport, which meant we had to start all over again as a domestic passenger carrying international luggage. We had to run from post to pillar to arrange for new tickets as AirIndia has told us there were no other seats available on that day to Bengaluru. The next available flight was at a very hefty price on the next day evening. We were told it was our fault to have not boarded the flight in time and so there was no compensation or any willingness to try to look for options to accommodate us. We even requested them to provide us the lounge facility if we bought the next evening tickets at exorbitant price (27K per ticket). They’ve denied even giving that to us. We were left stranded with very little options. We stayed at the airport all day looking for options. Fortunately we were able to book through another airlines and discovered that there is a cargo service which offered to transport our luggage at a reasonable rate. Please use cargo option if you’re ever stranded with international luggage. We finally reached Bengaluru around 2:30 AM. Ironically, this flight was delayed by one and half hours since some of the passengers could not board this flight in time due to delayed Srinagar flight. Glad this airline was willing to accommodate them despite such a delay. I fail to understand why Air India could not have waited for a few minutes more despite our checked in luggage! In all, we ended spending 70K for tickets and cargo for no fault of ours. Did Air India sell our tickets to others, what could be the reason?  Immigration  Priority should be given to the passengers based on their transit flight timings. You might end up last in the long line based on your seating position when you get out from your first flight. Baggage claim: Based on your family/group, it will take that much more time to get all your luggage identified and out. We lost a lot of time here. There was still luggage coming out on the carousel after we identified our luggage.  Customs and Check in luggage: While checking in luggage we had to battle through a big line amidst angry domestic travellers. There should be two different lines for domestic and international travellers while checking in the luggage. We lost a lot of time here. Security check: Again, domestic and international passengers need to have different lines. Travellers who were unable to board in spite of checking in their luggage should be accommodated in another flight without having them completely exited."

A crew member was very rude & disrespectful . I was feeling cold in the aircraft & had requested her to give me a blanket. She didn’t pay any attention to what I had said & ignored completely. After an hour i had reminded her about it & she didn’t listen to me. I reminded her while serving food the third time & still no courtesy to reply back. While serving drinks she forgot to hand me over my drink & moved on. I had to stop her & literally request to serve me my drink. She didn’t even bother to apologize.

Dirty plane, seats are dirty. Baggage check-in person was extremely rude. My bag did not arrive when I arrived. The phone# and email that I received from the baggage claim form is useless. Air India do not value their customers. No one will follow up regarding missing bags. After 50 phone calls and numerous emails with no response, we ended up going back at the airport three times, finally we had some luck with meeting with supervisor. After one long week, we received the bag. No compensation was provided for the troubles that we went through. It was the worst experience from our last travel. Every encounter we had, not one person made us feel that they cared. I am very disappointed with my travel experience."

This was my first experience after Tata had taken over Air India and this was the worst experience I ever had with an airline. The interior of the flight was quite old looking, passenger hand rest were broken and wrapped with insulation tape. Moreover, the seat was torn and dirty. I don’t want to mention anything about toilet cleanliness. Food quality was pathetic, quality came down drastically, not at all tasty. "

The ground staff was rude and did not know how to handle edge cases. I got sick due to extreme heat and on requesting priority check-in it was provided but the experience is worst than normal check-in. The duty Manager was rude and did not handle it well even on explaining the health condition. The Inflight experience was also not good. Food was stale (Breakfast and Lunch). The flight attendants were also not courteous and did not come to attend to the passenger (me) even 2 hrs after calling. InFlight entertainment was also not working. Seems flight attendants are there for sake of being there not for service. Better go for any other Airline.

Except for on-schedule flights, nothing seems to have changed under the new ownership. No entertainment system available and even the flight attendants seemed unaware. Then the lame excuse - ""our entertainment system is getting updated under new ownership"". We didn't even bother to try the entertainment system on any further leg. The Priority tags on the luggage were the biggest jokes, except at Heathrow, almost everywhere, we got our luggage almost at the end. During our return, we had a 4 hours wait at Delhi Intl. terminal and there was no lounge facility available. I would have expected them to have an arrangements with other airlines or providers. I feel, it will take time for Air India to change its archaic and unprofessional model."

During the 15-hour flight, none of the tv screens was working. The announcement was made over the public address system that the tv screens were faulty, for which they apologized.  AC too may not have been working because the air was humid and stuffy. None of the cabin crew came around offering water or other services.  Throughout the flight, people were walking up and down the aisle to fetch water. For lunch they also included the snack meant for tea, so crew can be spared the trouble of serving again at tea time. The flight was so deplorable that I cancelled my return trip to Vancouver by Air India and booked on Lufthansa instead, even though I had to lose a substantial amount of money. Never again Air India in my life."

No web check in from Vancouver as it is not in the drop down list.I called customer service and the poor lady could not help me much. The flight is totally basic. No inflight entertainment whatsoever. The seats are broken and dirty. No reading light or call button. Thankfully I was forewarned so I had downloaded movies for kids on their computers. I had booked seats with more leg space but despite me paying extra for this I did not get the chosen seats. This was frustrating. Nor will I get repaid for the extra fare I paid as now I dont have time to run after them. The heating system was overworking and the aircraft was boiling. When I asked staff to lower the temperature they were giving weird explanations that we are flying over north pole and temperature outside is minus 60. Finally one of them told me the aircraft is old and their was a technical glitch. The thermostat was not working. The saving grace was that most of the staff was hospitable and felt embarrassed by the poor quality aircraft themselves. They commiserated with us as they were not responsible for the poor quality provided by AI. The lady next to me helped me with my frustrated tired kids. On the whole I would not recommend this flight. New management has a huge task ahead of them.

The aircraft was so old and broken down. The seats were super uncomfortable. Most of the TVs did not work. The staff was extremely rude and did their job horribly. When I complained about the TV not working, they did nothing to help. The overhead lights and assistance buttons also did not work. When I asked for water, they told me to go to the back and get it myself. The bathrooms were disgusting. No toilet paper or hand sanitizer. Travellers were not even provided basic toiletries like toothbrushes and toothpaste even though it was a 16 hour flight. I will never be travelling on this airline again and do not recommend anyone else to either!"

95,March 2022,Melbourne to Delhi,Business,A Sahyra,22nd March 2022,3,Boeing 787,2,2,2,1,1,Business Class,1,1,Trip Verified,most mediocre Business class," I travelled in AI 309 Melbourne to New Delhi. It’s one of the most mediocre Business classes I ever travelled in. It is more like glorified Premium Economy. Some airlines premium economy is better than business class of Air India.  Enough Legroom and comfortable but Zero privacy to the extent you must share the table with the person sitting next to you. No storage whatsoever. Charging points not working. If you chose the windows seat, then then you must literally jump over the aisle seat person if they are sleeping. Inflight Entertainment: The inflight entertainment is laughable. If you are not Indian, you will have like 10 movies to chose from. TV shows have only one episode. No music to listen to. Food: Its typical Indian food be prepared for that. Service: They server two meals and a round of drinks of your choice. You will be asked for drinks twice only. Cost: it was slightly cheaper than other business class when I say slightly 1200AUD less than other flights. And I chose it, which is clearly a mistake. Will not recommend this carrier."

I've never been treated so badly in my entire life! I showed up for my flight 3 hours early. When I went to check in, I was asked if I had filled out the Air Suvidha form. I had not, as I had not been notified by Air India that this form was required, and I looked all over their website and found no mention of this form. I have been to India 4 times before and knew to have all my pertinent documents with me, which I did, but nobody told me I had to upload them to a special website. Filling out the form was impossible to do on a cell phone, I couldn't get the documents to be small enough, so the form kept being rejected. There was nobody there helping all the people who had not filled out the form because none of them were notified in advance. There were a half dozen of us that were not permitted to check in because we were unable to complete the form on our cell phones, among those turned away were an elderly couple and a young couple with an infant baby. This is totally unconscionable! The couple with the infant baby asked if they could at least be compensated with a hotel room, and the heartless Air India employee behind the counter said, sorry there is nothing we can do for you. Then to add insult to injury, when trying to rebook the flight, Air India is charging a $300 no show fee. This airline doesn't care in the least about customer service. I will never book a flight with Air India again. Do yourself a favor and book with a different airline."

However due to a personal emergency, I had to fly Air India recently since it was the only way I could get to Chicago in time. Air India has elevated the art of flying into a sublime torture on this 15.5 hour journey. The tortuous check-in process with agents taking upto 15-20 minutes to check-in a single passenger and the general chaos at the counter in Delhi was a precursor to the horrors which awaited me on board. The aircraft was run-down and shabby, which was the second warning but the best part was when I reached my seat, I had an exit row aisle right next to the bathroom which was so narrow that I could barely wedge myself in the seat with the the ancient inflight entertainment remote bulging out and pressing into my waist. Of course this fun was enhanced by the fact that in the entire economy section not more than 4-5 seats had a working IFE system the rest of us were entertained by staring at the Air India logo on the screen for 15 hours and they even gave us complimentary headsets so that we could enjoy the feel of the cheap headsets in our ears since the system was not working anyway, The seat itself had a worn out cushion and a weird back angle and barely usable headrests, I have never been happier to exit an aircraft just so that I never have to sit in this seat again. This was not the end of it of course, the airline decided that since the flight was scheduled at an ungodly hour of 2.45 am, it makes no sense to offer food to passengers who after traveling to the airport and spending an awesome time in check-in and immigration would just not be in the mood for sustenance so they dropped some chips and a packet of cheap biscuits on the seat and served breakfast only after 5-6 hours at least hunger made the awful food more edible. After this the crew decided to rest for 6-7 hours just handing out a cup of tea in between and while theoretically we could go to the galley to make our own tea/coffee they very considerately did not keep any cups or disposable paper cups to consume the said tea/coffee in. Perhaps a game of find the cup could entertain the passengers since the IFE could not. Finally a couple of hours before landing we were offered dinner which tasted slightly better than wet cardboard. The only redeeming factor on the flight was that Air India is surprisingly generous with alcohol and still offers good whisky and gin in good portion in economy but since this was only served to the end of the flight, it did not alleviate the misery in any way. The first thing I did after reaching my destination was to cancel my return ticket with them since there is no way I can put myself through such an experience again."
99,February 2022,Delhi to Toronto,Solo Leisure,P Vardel,7th March 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,No entertainment on 16 hr flight," Worst flight I travelled ever. My flight was of 16 hrs non stop and the screen in front of me was not working at all I was not able to watch any safety protocols or see where the flight is currently, route, weather conditions. No entertainment on the 16 hrs flight. It felt like I was in a black hole or something like that. I requested the flight attendants to turn the screen on or change the seat if the screen is broken and they responded in humiliating and disrespectful way and did nothing.  If the screen was not working why did you allotted the seat to me, it was very unfair with me."

The armrest was broken as shown in the photo here. They have screen but earphones don’t work. I asked for a cup of tea I was told we are serving food right now so later will bring it, after an hour I went again n was told sorry now we can’t give you anything as we will land in one hour and we forgot to bring before.

The seat recline didn't work the entire time, the seat was normal as an economy class. The main reason for us to buy the Biz class for the comfort of her travel which was not the case here at all. I have try calling AI since last three days no answer. If you try to book the flight the calls goes through immediately but if you call for any other reason no one ever picks up. I have submitted an online feedback no respond. I have sent an email no response. We were told by the crew member that since she had an issue with her seat she would get a refund back, but how will one get a refund if there is no way to contact anyone?  This was waste of our money. I do not recommend anyone to fly Air India."
103,February 2022,San Francisco to Delhi,Business,Anisha Judge,28th February 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Business Class,1,1,Not Verified,"plane was filthy,  entertainment non existent"," I had booked a business class ticket using miles for travel from San Francisco to Delhi on Feb 21st. The ticket was booked and a seat was assigned 2 months prior to travel. I knew that there was something amiss when I tried to check in 24 hours prior to departure as it kept asking me to contact an agent. Of course true to Air India’s style there was no way to get through to an agent. When I arrived at the airport and presented my confirmed ticket to the agent she without any explanation called her manager. This is where the rudeness and complete disregard started. The staff who is supposed to be a supervisor came and without a greeting or an apology states “you have 2 options, you can take a non working seat in business class or move to economy.”  When I said that neither of those options were acceptable she responded with “then I cant help you as I have to give your seat to a paying passenger” and in the same breath asked the agent to take the next passenger with no resolution to my situation or problem. When I refused to move she basically moved the agent to another desk and started talking to the next passenger, completely ignoring me as if I did not exist. I kept talking and she completely ignored me. I was also informed that she was the only manager and that I had no recourse. Imagine standing at the airport with a ticket in hand and no airline employee willing to do their job and get you checked in. I then walked over to the united counter to try to see if I could fly united – unfortunately the united flight had just closed so that option was lost to me. I explained my situation to the united manager, who then contacted Air India. At this time I realized that their staff had lied to me and that there was a manager higher than her on site. It took the involvement of another airline’s manager to bring the until now invisible Air India manager out of her office. She stepped in and informed me that the business class seat that they were willing to reassign me to (not my original seat) was manually functional ie. broken but could be moved manually. I had no choice but to accept this less than ideal offer. When I got on board, I did ask the flight attendant to check that the seat was indeed manually functional. At this time the ground staff reentered the plane and interrupted my conversation with the flight attendant by screaming in front of all the other passengers “I have spent 1 hour with this woman and told her that the seat is broken.” She was curtailed from continuing this rant by the flight supervisor and passengers sitting in 14A and 14C.  Anyway it so turned out that the seat was completely broken. They finally moved me to another partially broken seat. This seat required manual adjustment and even manually the foot rest would not come into complete upright position so essentially the FAA rules were broken during take off and landing. Finally the plane was filthy, the entertainment non existent and the food terrible. Anyway I made my way to Delhi in complete misery."

However, I did expect to see changes in the Soft Product like Ground staff, Cabin Crew, Inflight meals and most Importantly the On Time Performance. I was very impressed with the overall time management of the ground staff who ensured on time boarding. The Cabin crew was courteous and ensured that all the pax wore masks for the entire duration of the flight. Air India offers free refreshments or meals on a short 60 Minute flight like this one so I was served a refreshment box with a veg puff, tetra juice pack, Tomato ketchup and and the crew was kind enough to serve me another snack box when I requested. Overall it was a great short flight and would fly them again."

They don't provide pillow and blankets, they don't serve soft drinks, hard drink, tea or coffee on seat. You have to go the service station, sometime passengers don't know and they wait all the time for drinks. Like me and didn't announce that. For snacks they serve that 10rupees bread cold sandwich and  breakfast quality is ok. When you ask them for these things they give excuse of COVID. So from my experience I would not recommend anybody to travel with them."

I arranged to pay but they asked to see the negative report of the new test. When I brought the report I was told now the change fee had increased to 4500 rupees. In desperation, I agreed but was told they would only change the flight after I brought the luggage that was checked on the earlier flight. I got my luggage and as expected the counter staff of Air India told me now the change fee had become 7000 rupees. I was desperate to reach my destination and paid it but I dread to even think the plight of those who were wailing at the counters since they did not have the means to pay."

I tried booking online from Australia and everytime the payment failed. Then I tried booking via the tickets via their 24 hrs helpline and I had to call their call center multiple times for a total duration of 5 hrs before I could finally book the tickets. For every call, the Call center agent verifies the details again and then transfers the call to the ticketing team for booking, cancellations, rescheduling and refunds. But then the call gets disconnected invariably after 30 mins. I faced this same issue when I tried to reschedule my return domestic flight as my original flight was cancelled. Why can we not access the direct line to the ticketing team when are actually choosing that option while calling the call center? I think this is the biggest pain, please fix this. I will not prefer to travel with Air India unless I am in a pinch. Online booking and Call center delays are the biggest two issues which will keep the customer away, so please fix this."

Had to do so at the time of check in to ensure that the United frequent flyer was printed on the Boarding Pass. Air India should ensure that any Star Alliance number can be inserted into the booking. Check-In Almost trouble free - the staff at Toronto was diligent in verifying vaccination status and RT-PCR test results. Staff must be trained to insert the Frequent Flyer number from other star alliance airlines. Boarding delay and nothing but chaos! There was no separate queue for business class. The counter was surrounded by passengers and the boarding was not started at the scheduled time. Smooth flight, great Boeing 777  and great meals! However, after the first 2 hours, the toilets were not looked after and supplies were not re-stocked. Extraordinary courtesy by cabin crew, very helpful to the families with kids and senior citizens. Air India Lounge at Delhi airport with very little supplies and hardly any variety of food. Cramped space during the pandemic. I flew from Delhi to Mumbai after the 14 hour flight from Toronto to Delhi. It was another chaotic boarding with 1 person at the boarding point and a lot of interference by Air India non-flying crew members as they tried to get best seats for themselves and their family members having passes. My own business class seat was changed in favor of a Captain's daughter flying on the flight. Air India can do much better by not disturbing or bumping around paying passengers in favor of non-paying ones.

119,November 2021,Mumbai to Goa,Solo Leisure,J Kultin,1st December 2021,1,na,3,1,1,na,2,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,customer support has been absolutely pathetic," I flew Air India on a single-leg domestic flight of less than an hour. Unfortunately Air India lost my luggage on this flight. While I understand that accidents like these happen on any airline, Air India's customer support has been absolutely pathetic ever since. Calls to generic customer support lines that can be found online either don't work or connect to someone who cannot help after waiting for long periods. The specific phone numbers I received to the team handling my case at Goa airport do not answer to my calls or messages (even confirmed that they do answer when called from a different number, so I strongly suspect them of ignoring my specific phone number). At this point it has been almost two weeks since losing my bag, and a week since I last managed to get through to Air India (despite daily attempts to do so). In short this experience with customer service is extremely frustrating, and having to deal with them has made my trip much worse than it had to be without luggage. Apart from not having much confidence in Air India trying to return my luggage to me, my attempts to get compensated for (1) additional expenses made for new clothing and toiletries and (2) for the value of the bag if not found after 21 days has been frustrating as well. I was instructed at the airport to send my receipts to an email address specific to the Goa team, after which my case would get updated with them and I'd retrieve the compensation by picking it up in cash at any global Air India office. Unsurprisingly I have not heard back on this email address after a week, and even if the compensation would have been honored in my case the idea of having to physically go to an office after I leave India is bonkers. In my many desperate attempts to get any sign of life on my case from Air India the only place where they have been sort of responsive is through Twitter, but even they do not seem to be able to get an update from the luggage team actually handling my case. Concluding, I would advise everyone to avoid Air India at all cost as any circumstance in which you'd have to deal with their customer support will be extremely frustrating. While I would expect non-budget national carriers and Star Alliance members offer some basic level of service, this is not at all the case for Air India."
120,November 2021,Mumbai to Goa,Business,Lilesh Karade,28th November 2021,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,worst experience with this airline," Recently I traveled with Air India and experienced a worst experience with this airline. We were travelling from Mumbai to Goa and due to congestion in traffic it almost took us 2 hrs for travelling a distance of 8 KM to Terminal 2. The flight was at 9 PM and we reached at the desk at 8.15 PM. The Air India Personnel rudely told that we cannot be allowed to board the flight as we are late and have not done the web check in. It was surprising that though we had done the web check in it was not showing on their portal. Later I have checked with many passengers who informed me that the Airline Portal always had some issues while web check in and though you complete web check in it will not show in their portal. Finally, all the personnel to whoever I spoke instead of helping me out from this situation was blatantly blaming me for my delay in reaching the airport, and made sure that I should not board in the flight. Another harassment started when I went to the booking office to book the tickets for another flight of Air India. The booking officer on other side of the glass/window was asking me to speak loudly as he was not able to hear my requests made. I kept on shouting and informed him of my desire to book a tickets to Goa. He somehow understood my requests and started browsing the portal for five minutes and got up to make some phone calls. I asked him what is happening ? to which he replied that he is enquiring with his superiors for booking tickets. After five minutes I lost my patience and left the window. Secondly, their call centres are closed after 18:00 Hrs. A recorded message will be heard continuously after 18:00 HRs that you are in queue, but no one will respond from the other side nor the IVR facility will be available. I travelled with Indigo so many times but the way they help me out during the distress is commendable. In similar situation at Chandigarh airport when I reached just before 30 minutes of scheduled flight, they made sure that I boarded in the flight with my family. Their personnel accompanied me from entrance of the airport up to the flight. Now I can understand why this airline is in losses from so many years. The attitude of the staff is sinking this boat."

Passengers were provided a meal once only and status updates were not given frequently which left people clueless and frustrated. In terms of interior, seats can't be pushed back more than an inch, screens not functioning properly, provided meal was also tasteless. Overall the worst experience. When I asked an attendant to provide water, she said it was kept in the galley, get it from there. Blanket and cushion is not provided in flight.

I was travelling on 12th Nov 2021 from Ahmedabad to Chicago via Delhi. My flight was at 7:35 PM and I was inside airport at 5:30 PM. The Airport ground crew of Air India, stopped me and said we can not travel to USA as my infant child is holding Canadian passport and so she can't travel USA without valid B1/B2 VISA. They didn't even know that Canadian passport holders gets on arrival visa to enter USA. When I showed both of them the proof of USA & Canadian federal website and rules about the same that Canadian passport holders are allowed to travel USA and get on arrival visa. That supervisor told me ""people can write anything in their website, so we don't consider federal website as a proof"" I was shocked knowing they were not aware about the rule. When my travel agent directly contact to higher authorities from Air India and explained that they are wrong, I was issued board passes after 2 hours of harassment by Air India. The aircraft was so dirty and unhygienic to even fly. This was very old aircraft and there was food stuck in side the TV remote and all inside the seat corners. The seats were even damaged and broken joints for food tray."

I have to use my own lap to eat the food. I have asked for Non-Veg, as I have already eaten Veg first time - Flight attendant answer - Sorry no options and Veg is the only option. My next seat customer has got the Non-Veg after some heated discussion, still no luck for me.  Seat recliner push-button broken hence can not push back. Flight attendant response - Cant do anything, we will check and sort this in London. Forget about charging ports, as all the USB ports are broken and inhouse media needs to reboot twice to work the Multimedia. I request to provide me with a blanket as I have seen few customers were offered. Flight attendant said we don't have enough in stock."

In summary, if you have a choice - please choose another proper airline. This was a flight long haul from London to Bombay. The ticket was booked in economy and upgraded to Business Class using FR miles. Prior to flying I needed to contact customer services and this was a nightmare. I wasted hours of my time trying to call them. I managed to get through to one person, who when I explained the problem just shouted back what’s the problem, what’s the problem. Then he put me on hold and a different man who was more well spoken answered and then lied to me that he was going to arrange a video call back in 2h. Very confusing that he would say that, and not try to help me, and not collect any of my personal details. I never did receive any support and when calling back the telephone queue was like a prank call, with the queue position going up and down like a yo-yo. Shocking, beyond terrible but the worst part is those lies from customer services, that really damages Air India’s credibility with me. Anyway I went to the airport, I was concerned about extra check during COVID times so I arrived 3.5 hours before departure. Air India refused to allow me to check in early, despite the Business Counter being in use by economy passengers. Now I know I was early, so partially my fault. However at one stage other BOM passengers were being allowed to join the economy queue while I had to wait for be allowed to go to the Business Class check-in. By the time I checked in, there was one BOM economy passenger I recognised that reached the counter before me. Business Class is meant to be a premium product to take the hassle and stress out of travelling, or add a little luxury. I travel in economy for personal travel about 99% of the time, as we all have bills to pay. However when I upgrade to business class, I expect to enjoy it and see the benefit. After this ordeal I was able to enjoy at the lounge facilities at London Heathrow, luckily it was a Star Alliance lounge run by another airline, phew! I’m glad it wasn’t an Air India lounge, lest I would be subjected to further torture. At the boarding gate more fun and games I’m afraid. One giant mess of a queue to have temperature readings before going to the boarding desk. This meant there was no discernible difference between economy and business class passengers, just one big line to wait in. More stress and hassle which was supposed to be avoided. On the plane, as expected a tired cabin, outdated infotainment. The seat was comfortable but lacking some adjustment options. The infotainment screen was low resolution, and difficult to use compared with modern equivalents on proper airlines such as Etihad. The Business Class cabin is what you would expect on a shorter haul flight, such as 4-5h, not a 9+h flight. I will write a complaint to Air India. I don’t expect to receive anything back."

My seat was also changed post boarding while entering the flight manually without my consent like it was a local train. When I asked for a reason later they stated it was because I was a solo traveller. The staff was also very aggressive in their tone and behaviour.

They had merged our flight with Indore and so we went Amritsar via Indore. We had to attend function and that's why we took early flight so that we reach on time.

One of the most impressive thing about Air India is their 25Kg Luggage allowance. The flight was on time and landed before scheduled arrival time though there was no meal service, the crew distributed water bottles and Safety kits. The IFE was working well but due to short course of flight I just had the flight tracker on. Overall a wonderful experience."

I cancelled the ticket in April 2021 and waited till Oct 2021 for my refund. I called them at least 10 to 15 times within this 4-5 months period. Every time, they say it is in process or they have initiated the refund. Finally, on 14th Oct. 2021, I called them again and requested the status. The lady, who picked my call first was so impatient and she forwarded my call to some other department and didn't even wait for me to finish what I was trying to say. The next customer service assistant told me they don't have some number required from the booking agency. Then I asked her why you guys did not tell me this all these days (I must have called them at least 10-15 times, every 2 weeks I used to call). I requested her to connect me to the Manager/Supervisor. She immediately disconnected the call. I'm an Indian, but I will try my level best to avoid Air India. If you are fine dealing with unprofessional and rude customer service, go ahead and book your ticket."

The air steward came to help and assisted me cleaning up. He offered me and the nearby passenger change in seats. Throughout the journey this steward gave me company whilst doing his duties. He made me drink water every half an hour and offered me biscuits. At the end of the trip he made sure I was all okay. 
135,September 2021,Delhi to Goa,Family Leisure,G Palaya,29th September 2021,1,na,1,1,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,most terrible experience ever," One of the worst flight ever with the worst ever staff. We booked an air india flight to Goa, but the flight was horrible so was the ground staff as well as the people sitting at the reception. There was an 11 month baby with us. At the time of check in we requested the ground staff to provide a better seat to at least the baby and the mother if not anyone else. But they did not cooperate. The air India website is so so poor. This is the first airline in which there was no choice of choosing a seat during web check in. I have traveled so many times before, each airline gives you a chance to choose the seats but that wasn't the case with this airline. Rather we got the last seat of the airline i.e., the seat near the washroom. It was smelling so bad and there was no one to listen to us. Again while coming back from GOA the same thing happened. The same seats were allotted. I called on their customer care and for like 25 minutes no one picked up the call. After 25 mins one of the customer care executive picked up the call and she was so rude. She said i am transferring the call but nothing happened after that I tried calling them again and then there was no response from their side. While calling the Air India customer care even if u are in a queue, your wait time and queue position keeps on increasing instead of coming down. The staff was highly rude and no cooperative and it was a terrible experience. The mother with the infant wasnt given any preference for the seat even after requesting them. It was one of the most terrible experience ever. "

Air India was delayed by 2 hours. Then they said flight is delayed by another 3 hours. Later they said flight is cancelled, there was no bad weather or any adverse conditions. Because of them my connecting flight got missed. I was traveling with my wife, 2 years old girl and 1 year boy. Whole night we had to spend on airport. No accommodation, food, or refund provided. Had to purchase 4 new tickets. Staff at Delhi airport was so rude. We were crying over there with kids, never felt that helpless in my life. It was a nightmare."
137,September 2021,Chicago to Delhi,Solo Leisure,K Narani,12th September 2021,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,Absolute nightmare," Absolute nightmare. boarding delayed for 15 hours due to technical difficulties and no option to cancel/reschedule flight. All they said is that they will take care of everyone. Now, that would be spending another night at the airport and wait time of 12 more hours for connecting flight to destination. Used to be a convenient direct airlines to India but this is such a pathetic and horrifying experience. I would never travel again with Air India. Senior citizens with might think it is convenient to travel directly from US to India but on the contrary it is an absolute nightmare."

They are just fetching money from its flyers. I reached at window 45mins prior to my flight departure. And they said that boarding is closed. And they cannot do anything with it, and we have to book a new ticket and have to pay full amount. We cancelled our plan to take next flight. But on schedule board it was showing same flight was on boarding stage till 15mins prior to departure. There were more people like us. "

My boarding pass was already printed and given to me with the seat I had chosen at booking, but Air India staff subsequently assigned my seat to someone else. On the plane, when I raised the issue, the cabin crew and counter staff failed to rectify the situation. They then moved me to a demonstrably worse seat, one without a TV, which all other passengers had. Mind you, this was for a 15-hour flight. I understand that people sometimes need to have their seats shifted, but surely there were others on the plane who hadn't paid for their seats, so their seats should be changed, not those of us who paid for our seating. In addition, it's outrageous that Air India would give my seat to someone else after I checked in and had the my boarding pass with my proper seat number printed on it."

The service provided on the flight was the worst. No blanket, no pillow, no coffee/tea nothing. As per air hostess, the flight was under COVID-restriction travel, so nothing to be provided to the passengers. I don't understand then why they are charging more from us, if you don't want to provide us with all amenities. If this was a COVID flight, we expect some cleanliness but there was no hygiene. The air hostesses were so rude sometimes. They didn't allow us to use some restrooms because of their safety concerns. Really! As we are traveling, this doesn't mean that we have COVID. We all sat on that flight with a negative COVID test, at least give us some respect. I will never recommend."

They treat passengers as if they are traveling on a free ride with the airline and have no plans to reach the destination. There is no acknowledgement about the delays and no support for refund or reschedule. The refund takes more than 6 months sometimes! My Luggage was damaged and Company ID was lost while returning from Udaipur to Mumbai. How can this airline treat passengers so casually?"

No update given on their website or info to travel agents. I was suppose to cancel my flight to Tirupati but as there customer care lines are down, I had to call them back next day of my booking. Since I did not reach out to them 24 hours after the ticket was booked, the amount is not refundable. Stop booking Air India rather Indigo really helped me with regard to full refund."

Even now it shows that the status as confirmed. We went to the airport with all the luggage and all and we came to know that Air India flights are not been flying since more than a month now. So now why are we allowed to book the tickets when the flights are not flying at all. Secondly the systems at Air India Customer care are not at all updated and they have no idea or update of the current status of the flights. We would have called at least 10 times and every time they mentioned flight is confirmed and later after several transfer to escalation team and all we get to know that flights are not flying. Now at maharaja we got the update that the flight is not flying, however it is a scam and trying to fool people as till yesterday in maharaja It was showing out name and details for the particular flight but today is says it is cancelled. Are the website and customer care people not aware of the current status or are they doing it knowingly to collect money from people and not refund it.Its a big scam going on that too when Indian government is involved. Now when we call for refund we are directed to several teams on the call on long waits and no one is able to give a proper solution. Not sure if we will ever get the money back. Really frustrated, along with that we also did the RTPCR test which cost around 600$ for 3 of us. we had given several calls before going for the test just to be sure and conformed and the Customer care guys mentioned it is confirmed. At the Airport we met 4 other families who had booked on the same flight on same date and were facing the same issue. I am sure Air India is earning a lot from these false booking and not refunding the money. People be aware before you choose Air India. I know these writing and comments doesn't effect Air India however just for the knowledge and awareness for people to be cautious and not suffer."
144,May 2021,Newark to Kolkata via delhi,Business,E Sanhee,7th July 2021,1,na,na,na,na,na,na,Business Class,1,na,Trip Verified,good for nothing customer support," They will take your money and you will never see it again, even if you do your due diligence and cancel within 24 hours, even if you call them every other day for 2 month, wait on hold for hours, write 20 emails and create 5 escalated cases with their sub standard, rude and good for nothing customer support agents. All of the above happened to me. I booked a business class ticket and tried to cancel online but the system was down so I called to cancel within 24 hours. But the customer support agent casually said, and I quote ""please call back later. The system is undergoing maintenance and I cannot cancel at this time"". That was my first red flag. What kind of an agent cannot cancel even if the user cannot cancel? So I left an email asking them to cancel within 24 hours. I called several times after that and I got the same response:  I'd have to pay the $200 cancellation charge because the 24 hours has passed. Otherwise, they said its wise to hold off on cancelling until my escalated case would be reviewed by someone at a higher level. That the customer agents do not have access to emails because they just dont and only the backend team can see my emails That I'd get a response within 24 to 48 hours (but didnt). Even if I did, it was always automated or tightly scripted (was I ever talking to a human?). Exhausted with the constant back and forth and going nowhere for 1 month but before my flight date, I called them to cancel my booking, agreeing to pay the $200. I was promised that my escalated case would be seen to and I'd get back my $200 fee but it never was. I left them multiple requests in email, on their feedback form but talking to these people is like talking to a wall. "

If you check their Twitter Account everyday people are asking for refund but they give pre scripted typical answers to everyone.

No availability of online-check in, no line management for different types of check in (at the counter, online). After 45 minutes of standing in the queue, as there were not enough Staff for the number of passengers checking in, boarding began with the boarding pass being checked minimum 4 times (could never understand why this happens on Indian domestic and International flights only). No inflight entertainment, seats were broken. Food was the only plus which made the journey bearable. Overall- very disappointed, and it seemed from their lacklustre service that Air India just doesn't care. No improvement during the return leg of the journey from Del-Fra. They capitalised on the Passengers vulnerabilty during the Holidays by putting in service the old-worst serviced planes. PS: the prices were 1,5 times the normal prices."

We all book as at least we can have a nonstop flight from COK. But they will cancel the flight 4 or 5 days before your return journey.

Changing a flight is a pain - you have to contact customer service and it takes forever and is not transparent. Flights are super old - my moms entertainment system screen was white for the entire trip and didn’t work. Mine wouldn’t turn on. Seats seem like they’re over 10 years old with all kinds of stains. Flight delays galore, all the flights were delayed by at least half hour and the worst was 3 hours. "

We booked a flight for a later date which had to be preponed. We called the customer service department and requested to reschedule the flight to a month earlier. We paid the fare difference and in spite of all that we were not given the itinerary. We called them for three days literally, 20 times. Now, they are asking us to pay more amount. We requested for full refund and they are only giving us 600 rupees out of 6000. I am going to make sure that I never book any tickets from this airline."

Check-in and boarding were smooth. They served good food on time, however, did not serve any drinks (coffee/tea/ alcohol). It was at the back of the airlines for self-service. Cabin crews were good to help. The most disastrous incident was not working og inflight entertainment. I just can not imagine that time how to pass nearly 14 hrs without any entertainment. I would download some movies/ songs if I knew earlier. Air India does not provide inflight internet. In most of the seats, inflight entertainment system was not working. Touch screens are hardly working. On the second leg (Delhi to Kolkata), it was of approx 2hrs flight without any inflight entertainment/internet service. Also, the air conditioning was not properly working on the ground. It was very suffocating after wearing mask and face shield. Air India is one of the two domestic airlines that provide hot meals.

I had very low expectations, and Air India was as bad as I feared. The Indian government should get out of the business of running an airline as soon as possible. Every aspect of this trip was subpar, and given a choice, I cannot imaging why anybody would ever travel on this airline. Here are all the ways in which they were bad: 1) Their web site is terrible, and it wouldn't accept my Lufthansa frequent flyer number, even though there is a section for entering partner airlines membership numbers. The web site also wouldn't allow me to request a special meal, and it gave absolutely no explanation for why. From some google research, I realized this might be due to covid precautions 2) I made 2 separate calls to their customer service center to try and address the above issues. The amount of background noise during both calls made it seem like their reps were sitting in the middle of New Delhi railway station for their calls. I could barely hear or understand what the reps were saying. They supposedly entered my Lufthansa number for me, but as I could tell when I printed my boarding pass, it wasn't entered properly, and it didn't work. I had to claim my miles via Lufthansa after the flight On a separate call, the rep took my special meal request and entered it, but didn't seem to know, or didn't bother to tell me that special meals were not possible during Covid 3) My itinerary was IAD-DEL-MAA, on different B787s for each leg. I flew business class, and the product is really sub par. The seats are grimy, the upholstery was torn on one of the legs, the seat power didn't work properly. Worst of all for me, the moving maps didn't work on both IAD-DEL and DEL-IAD legs. Also, the flat bed isn't long enough for my 6'3"" height. The pillow they give is a joke. The cabin crew were nice enough, but I really didn't like the heavy/greasy Indian food I was forced to eat on some of the legs. The food on the MAA-DEL leg even gave me severe digestion problems. 4) Air India lounges were open in DEL or MAA, supposedly due to Covid, but other private lounges were operating, so it seems like Covid was just an excuse. 5) On a couple positive notes, all my flights were on time, which was a blessing, and the prices of the business class ticket was well below pre-pandemic business class levels."

The check in and baggage drop was quick and easy. The load on this flight was on the lighter side and so as a result the flight was by and large very uneventful.

I had to stand for 2 hours just to drop bags even after e-checking and when my turn came I was thrown here and there and charged Rs 20,000 for luggage weight. I don’t Mind giving the amount if it’s the rule and is legit. The desk person let go a girl without even weighing her carry on telling her, why do you want to weigh it, if you can lift it, that means it’s not that’s heavy, and the same guy charged me around Rs 600 per kg. I don’t mind doing that but what I saw him doing with that girl is totally unprofessional. Save yourself from a rude experience by not traveling by Air India."

The Air India staff from Delhi did not let me fly even when I had a valid PCR report with me. They were so rude and they stopped me from boarding telling that they need to verify my result. The supervisor at the Delhi Airport was being so irresponsible and later was not clearly saying anything about why I'm not eligible to travel. Then he later apologized and told me he will book one ticket for me the next day.  I stayed there from 1 am in the morning to 11 am talking to everyone in Air India asking about this issue. No one responded in a good way and even was laughing at me. The supervisors are even worse with no responsibility. They even took back my boarding pass from Delhi to Toronto to take away the proof.

Also when doing the web check in, I was also surprised to see that the system was unable to recognize the PNR which was quite strange, however the mobile check in was successful and even though the timing of the flight was uncertain, just 1 day before the departure, the airline provided a confirmation of the flight timings via SMS. The baggage drop and ground process was quick and smooth. Boarding was on schedule and the departure was also slightly delayed by 15 mins due to the air show in Bangalore. However the crew made up for the time en-route. The airline has also resumed full meal service and lunch was provided which was a welcome addition. The meal was good and nice and we landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule which was good. The web check in experience could have been better and also the rescheduling was not exactly welcome but the inflight experience was quite nice and the crew was very good in looking after the passengers. I would fly with Air India again in the future for the right price and timing convenience but they need to try to minimize the rescheduling of flights."

However on the day the flight which was suppose to take off at 8:30 and reach Bengaluru by max 3pm on the same day took off at 11 from Assam which is understandable because it can get quite foggy during winter. But after reaching Kolkata there was no information or any message from the airline regarding the delayed flight to Bengaluru. My dad has a chronic kidney disease and its difficult to travel for long hour and moreover they are not frequent flyers. Not even a single staff from air India passed any kind of information and on enquiry they simply raised their eyebrow with that arrogant attitude. I wonder what they are so proud of I just wish i had their names. The airline completely forgot their customer. Such a terrible airline. There is more to it, so the flight was delayed from Kolkata to Bengaluru via Hyderabad again by LEGIT 11hr which was also unsure of. Finally they boarded the flight at 10:50pm and reached Bengaluru at 3pm. Overall these airline have the worst attitude towards their customer. "

Completely disgusted with my experience. After a year of chasing Air India for a refund due to a flight that they cancelled, I have yet to receive a single cent. I did not even find out about the cancellation until after I arrived to the airport and was informed at the check in counter. Apparently they tried to call me once and I didn't pick up. No email notification, nor text...nothing. Several emails went by without a response. For months I waited, repeatedly calling customer service, until I received an email saying they would only issue a refund when things returned ""to normalcy."" Now it has been 12 months. Half of the time you call their number, you will get a message saying it's the wrong number. The other half of the time it won't go through at all. When you finally reach them, you receive service from staff so incompetent it's obvious they were not even given basic training of how to look up information in their system. You feel sorry for them as they fumble around. I won't even blame the call center staff, as it's obvious the responsibility lies on the complete negligence of the Air India management to run an efficient operation. Why are airlines allowed to get away with this behavior? Any other business would have been shut down a long time ago. This is not a review of the flight experience itself, which is generally average, but if you can fly with a better airline, absolutely do it."
166,January 2021,Delhi to Amritsar,Solo Leisure,S Garheen,8th January 2021,3,na,1,3,1,1,2,Economy Class,2,1,Trip Verified,bad experience as always," Every time there a bad experience with Air India. This time I’m flyng Amritsar from Delhi. I’m currently in flight right now and writing this review. Before this there was a huge line for boarding where before entering the craft they were taking the luggage as there no space for luggage in the craft. While asking the reason for that they were silent. As per my knowledge one baggage is allowed per person so how come all the space is full? No explanation at all. When the lady sent me further where the guy is putting a luggage tag got offended when I asked him why is this happening. Rude staff, bad experience as always."
167,December 2020,Delhi to Toronto,Couple Leisure,D Pakra,2nd January 2021,2,na,3,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,2,1,Trip Verified,was our worst experience, We were coming back to canada from india on 31 of December and we faced a lot of problems on the Delhi airport the staff of Air India was so unprofessional and rude. The staff didn’t even know what documents they are required to check. They don’t mention anything before you book the ticket that what documents they are going to ask from you on airport for just giving you the boarding pass. How can a marriage certificate is required to get your boarding pass. Moreover we did online check in and booked our seats but on the airport they are giving us separate seats. It is not possible to sit separately from your family for a flight of 15 hours and then if you tell them to solve the issue they don’t even listen to you. Travelling with Air India was our worst experience till now. I hope this review will taken into consideration and steps will be taken to make the service better in future.

Ruwan at the ticketing counter and Rohit at the boarding gate, had sparkle in their eyes, spring in their steps and an infectious smile while attending to all sorts of queries of passengers yet not letting the guard down in these Covid challenging times. There pro customers behaviour and keenness to take that extra step for our satisfaction and making us comfortable is praiseworthy. "

Firstly, they deducted the money but didn't send the ticket. After numerous calls they finally gave the duplicate itinerary. Later due to COVID-19, the flight was cancelled. After numerous calls to their Customer Confusion Number, I could not get single value for cancellation charges. I got values from $100 to $ 400. They also told that under Melbourne to Delhi flight we still need to pay extra $ 1300. Total ticket price was coming almost three times the normal fare with no guarantee of flights. I immediately booked ticket for my mother in law in charter flights for only $ 1095. I submitted request for cancellation of e-ticket on 24 Nov 2020 to the specified email but did not received any response. After numerous calls they finally said that I need to lodge a ticket and the helpdesk, the details for which is no where mentioned on the website. In their initial response they informed that I should wait for 3-4 weeks with no mention of amount which will be credited. I am still counting at 34 days with no sign of refund. Wish I had the clock used by Air India as mine seems to be ticking too fast."

The flight was relatively sparse and check in was a breeze although at Bangalore airport the safety checks were at a higher level and the fares were quite reasonable which was good. The flight was on time and boarding started well in advance. The only thing that was an issue was the screen guards which were provided. I could not see anything with them on which didn't make sense because just a couple of months earlier, the screen guards were proper. So it must have been an exception. Landing also happened well ahead of schedule. At a time when all private carriers are trying to profit from this situation, Air India seems to be flying reliably during these times.

The plane took off on time, My IFE was not working for the Entire flight, I had a meal served About 2 hours into the flight, but it was disgusting. Cabin crew were relatively friendly, I don't credit this to Air India, as Indians are relatively friendly. The made the flight a little bit better for me.

And because of the Covid19 situation, After a lot of difficulty i found a domestic flight and flew from Bangalore to Mumbai to catch my flight. Unfortunately, i get to know they have rescheduled the flight to July 2nd after reaching there, and they didnt not bother to inform their passengers via mail or message about the same. They made me stand and wait for hours when i went to inquire and lied to me saying the flight had been cancelled and blamed it on the immigration. Many passengers like me who traveled to Mumbai, are stranded here and nowhere to go. Air India agreed it is their mistake and refused to provide any solution. Since we could not go out of the airport and had nowhere to go, we had to pay 9000rs per day and stay at the airport hotel for 9 days, total 72000rs (which was not affordable and we had to shell out all our savings). Air India has played with passengers emotions, made them waste lakhs of rupees, left them in helpless situations and separated them from families and left them alone to suffer. This is unacceptable and inhuman. Very rude staff at Air India counter in Mumbai."

Neither Super Travel nor Air India helping me to get back my refund. As per international airline policies i should get back 100% refund but they are pointing to each other so that they dont need to pay back my money. Both the companies has worst customer care service. They never help you but instead they force you to cancel. And Air India never responds to your mails

Me and my partner had purchased tickets to go to our final destination but as there was no direct flights, we had to book the flight to our destination via Delhi. The booking process was smooth especially when you consider that during the covid-19 crisis, most carriers were busy cancelling flights,  however we noticed that Air India flights were operating and looking at the previous record of flights we decided to go ahead with them. The tickets were on the high side but in these times having an airline actually fly instead of cancelling the flight is a game changer. The boarding actually started well before the scheduled time and as there were lots of passengers flying, a Boeing 777 was used instead of the Airbus. There was no food on this flight and for those allotted the middle seats, we had to wear the PPE equipment provided by the airline. Departure and arrival were both on time. So bravo Air India for once again coming to the nations rescue not only during the Vande Bharat missions but also during these difficult times. My impression of Air India during this crisis has increased leaps and bounds."

First they said they will refund half of the money I paid on my flight ticket which would be considerable at this stage but now they confirmed I will get no refund at all?

I had a booking with delta but Air India is not letting other airlines operate, forcing ppl to book their flights at 3 times the cost. My original Delta flight is $693, Air India charged me $1450, plus I need to book two other connecting flights separately. The reason given is other airlines May assign middle seats, whereas Everyone has crossed out middle seats Except Air India. Also Air India has quoted travel rules that go against international laws. I’m stuck here since 3 months and out of funds, now they are robbing me of my last reserves. The last time I travelled, they had no counter in Toronto Pearson airport, no announcement, flight departed early, next day on the flight the toilet was so disgusting it was a slap in my face. Service, food, entertainment everything was on the same level as the toilet. I pledge to never travel by Air India."

No representative or any person from airline was available to answer the queries / questions by all customers. We had a baby along with us who is just 3 year old and there were other passengers with infants struggling to know why the flight was cancelled. While i am writing this till that time we have not received any cancellation message or email. Pathetic service and highly not recommended to fly via this airline. If the airline does not send me any email or message i dont know if my money will come back or its donated to the airline. Please please don't go by this airline at all.

The flight date is 27th May. The Airline canceled the flight due to COVID-19 and is giving us two bad options 1) Rebook the ticket and the travel has to finish before 31 Mar 2021. My parents can only go there during summer vacation. This summer vacation is gone... not enough time to rebook for the next summer. 2) Cancel the ticket and cancellation charges are $350/person. I asked can I just not show up and cancel the flight in June and the representative only mentioned that the cancellation charges then would be different but could not tell me how much different ... lower/higher/same/similar. So I'm paying $700 to AirIndia for canceling the flight on me and offering no reasonable alternative. Needless to say I had to wait a really long time on the customer service call. My queue position during the call went from over 90 to 11 to 15 to 19 and 17 and then I suddenly got a call. I have no clue why they bothered to even have a queue on the call. Their chatbot or automated service does not really work.

Dinner was served about an hour after take off. I declined the meal because I had eaten in the terminal but from what I saw it seemed to be OK. I wanted to rest so I did not try the IFE. Baggage was waiting for me on arrival at the belt because I had an excessive delay getting medical clearance for Bangkok.

Only 2 staff for an almost full cabin so no smile or attention there. The food is only a choice of vegetarian or non-vegetarian; both Indian and spicy - even the one we were woken for at 3 am! For this we were charged $1600 one way, which reduced the next day to $1100! Obviously taking advantage of people needing to get home before the curfew then when plane was fully booked, making the price appear more reasonable. The only way this airline could be surviving is because they have non stop flights between destinations that no one else services. Terrible."

If you need it they will leave you for hours and hours waiting in the phone, and of course you have to pay for it, it's not a free call. Then if you are lucky and they pick up the phone, after several hours, then the nightmare starts, they pass you from one agent to other to finally hang out or just put you again up to waiting calls, no giving answers, not giving solutions. Now in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, they don't care about customers. And another nice detail is they can change your flight when they like, as many times as they like just by sending you an email. Never use it, you will regret it."

Food was very poor and I ended up not eating at all to be honest. Cabin crew was OK but not especially friendly. Booked emergency exit row so had LOTS of leg space which I think helped. Uneventful trip overall. Delhi-Mumbai leg was flown with a Boeing 747 that actually WAS 20 years old. Worn out and dirty. But good legspace also in economy and we were served snacks and drinks on this 2 hour flight. Landed a bit delayed and was 1 hour late out of Delhi. Enforced priority boarding on both flight (I am Star Gold) which is appreciated. Overall OK airline a good value for money. Only airline flying directly from Scandinavia to India so a good choice.

They don't care about the time and they are not afraid of anyone if we file a complain. As I asked for compensation, they told me that ""it's my fault that I booked a flight from Air India, So they will not help me for new tickets or not give any compensation."" They should learn some manners as they were really rude and they are not ready to help at all. I am personally saying, never fly with Air India. Worst Airline and worst staff ."

However the display clearly stated that this row was for international flights and when we queried this with at least a further Air India staff, they all said the same thing. The queue was long and slow and we appeared to be the only non Indian people in the queue. It just didn't seem right, so I went back the the first person who had directed me from desk G to F who then amazingly said I should go the desk G. I refused to do this and insisted that she check me in. She just glared at me and it was only I complained to her colleague that they agreed top do this. After a lot of muttering between them that printed tickets for seats 27A and 27B. I pointed out that I had paid for 11E and 11F, and again after further muttering a dirty looks I eventually got thje right seats. At no time did they apologise or make eye contact.

However, the cons of the flight are all passengers traveling to Raipur need to deboard at Jharsuguda, did the security, and reboard. As the same aircraft is going to Raipur, the airline may reduce passengers' pain by checking the boarding pass within the flight or at least just at the outside of the aircraft."

They announced that there was a massive delay of 6 hours just a couple of hours before I left for the flight and had no announcement other than a cryptic email that they sent. There were no instructions on the flight or at the airport, they did not provide lounge access. They offered me snacks in return for the 6 hour delay. I'd never recommend this airline. I'd requested a special meal and they did not even provide it adding insult to injury. The air hostess said she would look into it and get back and never did."

The guy behind me was very upset, as he said that his seat was falling apart. They moved him to another seat. The food was good. However, I am concerned about the state of the aircraft. Also, I am disappointed that the crew did not control the passengers when it was time to disembark. The aircraft was not even at the gate, yet passengers were all up and opening the overhead bins.

Air India was by far one of the worst airlines, I flew with. It was a more or less cheap flight, so the food and drinks were ok, though the breakfast was not edible in my opinion (some sort of croissant with cream cheese and ketchup?). The staff was very unfriendly. When you asked for something, like a glass of water or some help with the screen in front of you, which didn't work at all, or froze in the middle of a film, they helped unwillingly. During the return flight to Delhi, we had 2 hours delay, we said to the staff before boarding that we had a transfer flight to Vienna and we couldn't miss it. They said, that they would take care of it, but they didn't! So in total 12 people missed the transfer flight and had to wait 24 hours in the Delhi airport until the next flight. They provided dinner and breakfast at one specific restaurant, but didn't organize any accommodations, nor did they give us any care products or blankets to sleep (let me tell you, it's very cold and loud in the Delhi airport). I don't recommend this airline, they treated us very poorly and we didn't get any compensation for the LONG wait."

When we arrived at the airport we were abruptly told there had been a system error and that there was no seat for us on the plane which was fully booked. I wrote a letter asking for compensation on November 26 and sent a email a week later. Neither the letter or the mail were acknowledged. I have also tried to telephone but no luck there either. The phone is either not answered or I am passed from one person to the next before silence. I am a frequent international traveller and have never encountered such a problem. We missed a holiday we were very much looking forward to and are most disappointed.

Water was dripping over my head on the flight from San Francisco to Delhi.  My baggage was cleared after proper weighing in San Francisco. When I was transferring my baggage at Delhi airport for Delhi-Indore flight I was harrassed that baggage weight was different and I was forced to shuffle my stuff and throw out. They say we do not allow more than 4 kg laptop bag In spite of knowing that my laptop itself was 4 kg and there was charging cord and bag weight which they refused to allow.  I removed everything including charger from the bag. The staff at Delhi was very rude.

Anyway we proceeded towards gate no 29B as printed on it. When we reached on the designated gate we're shocked to see that no one was there. We're clueless but soon I received a call that your gate has been changed and now please report at gate no 34. We were finally boarded and reached Lucknow. As we're told in the plane we reached to belt no 2 to collect our checked-in baggage but another shock was waiting for us. We stood there for 10 minutes but couldn't find our baggage and soon there was display of Indigo flight number on belt 2. I took a chance and went to belt number 3 nearby and found my baggage on it while no display was available on belt number 3. All fellow passengers were frantically searching for their baggage.

Onboard the outbound flight two of the toilets nearest us were out of use as were two out of the three entertainment systems in our block of seats (in fact one was completely missing). After some time and having been re-booted the other system was back in action. The on-board staff were courteous and helpful, seats comfortable (we paid for the emergency seats with lots of space in front) and the food was ok but only choice was eat it or starve. Basically the same can be said for the return flights adding that the flight from Udaipur was nearly two hours late without any explanation.

Scheduled flight departure time was 8.10 p.m. from Kochi but the flight was delayed initially by 40 minutes than by 1 hour 20 minutes and finally took off at 10 p.m. with a delay of 1 h 50 minutes, and due to which I missed my pre-booked train from Mumbai to Vadodara. I had a similar experience during my earlier flight which I took from Mumbai to Trivendram on 26/10/2019. The flight was unnecessarily got delayed just because crew members did not arrive on time. When I claimed for train fare, I received terrible reply ""The flight AI-055 of 03 Nov 2019 was delayed on account of the late arrival of the incoming aircraft from Mumbai and the delay was unexpected and unavoidable.

This was my first time flying with this airline, and it will be the last. Both flights were delayed by hours, and no one took the time to provide any explanation as to why, or any apology for the inconvenience. The flight from Kathmandu to Delhi was delayed by 2 hours, and when it came to finally boarding the aircraft there was another security check of bags before you walked up the steps to the plane, it felt really disorganised and unusual given we had already gone through security. It almost puts doubts in your mind as if they don't trust the airports security process. When we got on the plane, the air hostess was rude and demanded I put my bag in the overhead locker despite just taking my seat and organising what I needed out of my bag. The food was not nice, and the plane was quite dirty. We were recommended this airline by a family member, I'm not sure if standards have dropped over the years, but it certainly was not up to ours given the air fare.

This 16 odd flight was really as bad as it can be. (1) There were no blankets supplied in most of the economy. When asked the flight attended simply said “We are sorry we ran out. When the ground crew said they only had used blankets from prior flight we refused for your safety”. (2) the in-flight entertainment system was broken and attendants simply said: “sir this is an old aircraft so many are broken - too bad”. Many “low class” customers travel in the Middle East / India sector and don’t know how to use the system and end up breaking it”. (3) food. I traveled by Air India many times and their saving grace was always good food. But this time I noticed it was super frugal (just an entree and small piece of bread ). To understand all this I struck up a conversation with one of the attendants and learned some stunning truths. He said “ sir everyone in Air India is aware of the poor quality of aircraft, non-working in-flight entertainment systems etc. but don’t seem to care. In fact, we file a detailed report after each flight, citing customer grievances, key issues etc, but nobody that can impact the situation cares. Net, it is a leadership problem. There are no customer service metrics attached to senior operational leaders’ performance evaluations and hence the outcome, As long as India government subsidies with plum jobs, customers like me can refrain from using Air India but that will not matter at all as economic forces are not at play here, For those wondering, the fare between United Airlines and Air India for this same route was almost equal (United was actually $100 cheaper and Air China was 50% lower), so Air India does not have the proverbial price advantage. I also learnt 2 new aircraft were acquired for traveling public but later converted to Air Force One for political leaders. The older aircraft if used for fare paying public. The business model is unsustainable. In new India, will someone take notice?"

A good breakfast of idli and pongal was provided which was hot and fresh.

On my flight to Chicago, the crew was excellent and extremely helpful and the  experience was quite comfortable, let down only by malfunctioning screens. On the other hand, my experience on the return flight from Chicago to New Delhi was really bad. Right from the unhelpful staff, to shoddy screens and toilets not working, spending those 14 hours was a nightmare. So, overall I still don't know whether to recommend Air India or not, only thing is fly only if that's the cheapest deal anyone is getting."

On this flight, even though the cabin was completely full, the flight departed and arrived on time. It was pleasing to note that the crew still made announcements during the safety demonstration and at other times instead of having that automated like the LCCs. It adds a personal touch. The breakfast was hot and filling and the overall attitude and demeanor of the crew was positive. One area which prevents them from getting a full rating was the fact that it was observed that the in-flight magazines were not placed in the seat pocket of each and every seat which perhaps should have been there. As on flights with a slightly longer duration, having something to read would have been really helpful. But compared to other airlines such as the LCCs, Air India provides a much better experience and service. The baggage was retrieved very quickly. Thank you for a comfortable flight."

The only positives are it’s direct and left on time. The plane was badly damaged on the inside. The clientele really don’t look after the planes. The seats were damaged or squeaky, the tray tables broke, netting to hold books iPad etc broke and then the toilets. They were gross. Worst toilets I’ve ever seen on an airline. Also in two that I went into the seat was broke and wouldn’t stay up on it’s own accord. The food was terrible. IFE was sufficient for the 8hours. The crew’s on board safety was awful. None of the safety checks were carried out when landing or taking off. I have to admit I was excited to Air India. But overall the experience was shocking."

It was just 3.5 hour flight, they started beverage service just half hour after flying, not a bad selection of beverages,after that dinner, option of veg,chicken or mutton, was ok but earlier on same route got better.

The flight was slightly delayed by an hour or so due to crew work time limitations being exceeded but this was communicated well in advance and so there was also no adverse consequences as a result of that. The flight in itself was a very standard fare with breakfast served and the crew being fairly warm and receptive. Had it not been for the delay this would have been the perfect flight but nevertheless an enjoyable and comfortable flight experience. Also travelling on the Airbus A320 Neos is quite good as they are newer aircrafts and more fresh.

"," San Francisco to Delhi via Hyderabad. This was the first time I was flying Air India, and I have truly never used a worse mode of transportation ever. Air India has the worst aircraft with the most ancient entertainment systems. But that is a mere inconvenience in the harrowing experience that Air India considers to be an acceptable journey. After missing my connecting flight at Delhi International Airport, thanks to the inefficient airport security, and spending the night at the airport, when it was time to check-in to my new connecting flight, the Air India personnel at the counters were extremely curt, unhelpful and uncooperative about checking in my luggage that was already cleared from my previous flight. Upon boarding my next flight, I was welcomed to an unclean seat and food tray. Once I finally landed at my intended destination, Air India managed to lose one of my checked bags, which I was reconciled with after 6 days. This experience has definitely turned my family, friends and me away from Air India as future customers."

I was told that I now had reserved window seats on every one of my flights and there was no need to check in online. It was all done. I arrived at Heathrow and took my pre booked window seat to Delhi. On 14th April arrived at Delhi international airport at 09:50 in the morning to fly to Kathmandu. The flight was due to leave at 12:50. 3 hours later. I queued with my luggage for almost 2 hours. When I got to the check in desk I was told that Air India had over booked the flight so I would not be able to fly that day and would have to fly the following day. I protested and said that this would not do. I spoke to several members of staff and two managers. I was pushed from pillar to post. I demanded that Air India put me on the next available flight with whichever carrier they could. I was told that this would not be possible as the only other flight to leave that day was a Nepal Airlines flight which was already full. I persisted. Finally they called Nepal Airlines who agreed to put me on the flight if there was a cancellation and the 2 airlines would sort out everything between themselves. While I was waiting I questioned the Air India representative who informed me that it happens quite regularly and that every week at least one or two passengers do not get their seats due to Air India over booking their flights. He said that confirming seats for my future Air India flights by telephone was not a guarantee that I would get the seat because priority would be given to people who book their seats online and if I ever was to confirm my seat by telephone then Air India's policy is to advise customers to arrive at the airport to check in at least 4 hours prior to departure. The agent in the UK said nothing about this when I confirmed my seats with him. A seat came up with Nepal Airlines at around 14:35. I was told to hurry forward. I did so do with the Air India representative towards the Nepal Airlines check in desks. However when we got there the Air India Representive informed me that I would be liable for the excess baggage as Nepal Airlines allow only 20 kilos of luggage whereas my luggage allowance with Air India is 46 kilos. I refused to pay; It was not my fault that Air India over booked their flight so why should I, the passenger be penalised for their utter incompetence. "

We chose them because they were offering the best times for both trips (but they changed them later from 8.40 in the morning to 2.40 in the middle of the night - and they do this apparently regularly). On both flights (actually all 4 flights because there is a stop over in Delhi) the online check-in was not working - as a result my family of four were spread all over the plane. In one case they booked as in row 23, but the aircraft only has 21 rows. So their IT is simply not working, everything is utmost slow (it took us 20 minutes to check in at the desk in Colombo). The aircraft from Colombo to Delhi is really old and dirty and this in combination with a non working IT, you don't believe that they really care about technical standards and safety. The entertainment system didn't work on both flights from FFM to Delhi. Every passenger needed numerous resets to get the minimum going - the minimum means a really small collection of outdated movies. I think even 15 years ago other airlines had better entertainment systems. This is clearly not acceptable. Sleeping was also difficult because we had numerious kids crying on all flights. The only positive aspect: some of the staff (not all) tried to do their best to solve the problems. So at least for us: never Air India again no matter how good their flight times are or how cheap they are. It is a shame that they are a member of the Star Alliance group."

Pleasantly surprised by Air India Business Class. The cabin only has 18 comfortable seats which make excellent beds at the press of a control. The layout is 2x2x22 so you could be unlucky if travelling alone as not much privacy. Get an aisle seat for mobility. The food for main meals was delicious especially the vegetarian options. The drinks service was limited but all that is needed. The cabin crew on the long leg were kind and helpful, One elderly man took ill and they did everything they could to help him. The entertainment options are limited but the seat and bed are great value. Transfers at Delhi are slow and understaffed and need upgraded body screening equipment.

This was the worst flight I've been on. First of all it was a last minute decision to fly to India regarding a family emergency so we booked an inexpensive flight and that flight was air India. The staff were rude to us and the the tray table was filthy and had bits of dried up food stuck on it, when I reported this to the stuff they handed me a tissue asked me to it clean up. You could have at least cleaned up the aircraft for the passengers to use and I take this offensive because hygiene is important to me. Next when we reached Delhi we were told to collect our luggage from the luggage belt and load it on to the next flight because it was a domestic one, this was the first ever time any airline had asked us to collect our luggage when we hadn't even reached our destination. At first we weren't sure because we had flown before and this had never happened so I asked the people at the information desk for help, there wasn't anyone else there but for some apparent reason the people at the desk couldn't see me I said excuse me about three times before someone looked up from their phone and when they did they were unhelpful and they looked at me like how could I disturb them from they're phone's. All in all it was a horrible experience and I will never fly on this airline again."

First flight with this airline, and pleasantly surprised. Aircraft staff were friendly and attentive, food was great and wine free flowing. The seating style seems a little old fashioned, but provided for more comfortable sleeping as your leg positions aren’t as constrained as in the latest corral style business seats. Air India also provided crisp cotton covered quilts in addition to a lighter day blanket. On the Tel Aviv to Delhi leg we were offered pyjamas; perhaps we could have asked for them on the next leg. The staff at the lounge at Delhi was the only weak point. The lounge itself was well provisioned and well equipped, apart from the lack of a shower, but the woman at the desk was unhelpful to the point of rudeness."

For some reason they would not accept the passport and my marriage certificate as a proof of that. My Indian visa is on my maiden name. I tried to reason with them that the US government takes security seriously and that they issued my new passport, drivers license, social security card etc. only after verifying everything. The airline demanded that I produce a court document showing name change - I dont have a court document nor does any one that I know. That is not what we do in the US for marital name change. They refused to let me get on the airplane with this reason. I was literally travelling to India for two days to attend to a family emergency and I couldn't make it. The worst part is the way the Air India staff in JFK treated me. One would expect that they would try and help the passenger but the person incharge  was extremely rude and treated me like I was not human. I was literally in tears explaining to them that I have traveled like this before and no other airline objected. Like banging your head on a wall"
281,July 2019,Mumbai to Bengaluru,Business,V Anand,17th July 2019,10,A319,5,5,5,na,5,Economy Class,5,na,Trip Verified,great value for money,"Mumbai to Bengaluru by Air India. On this late afternoon flight to Bengaluru, the flight was on the lighter side and so, as a result, the check-in process was a breeze and boarding started well before the scheduled boarding time. A light snack was provided consisting of a savoury cake and samosas/pav bhaji and the portions were generous in quantity which was well appreciated. The crew was friendly and engaging which was good. The flight departed on time and arrived well before the scheduled arrival time which was a huge plus. Air India provides great value for money and they should keep it up."
282,June 2019,Washington to Delhi,Solo Leisure,Amarjit Singh,7th July 2019,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,never flying with them again," Washington to Delhi. I had a family emergency, so I bought whatever ticket was available. Unfortunately, it ended up being Air India. I flew from Denver to Washington on United (Code Share) and then Washington to Delhi on Air India. The flight was delayed by a couple hours. Also, the boarding process was a mess. I stood in the line for like 45 min and then they asked me to get a new boarding pass when I was just about to get in, then put me back at the end of the line! I did not find my bag at the baggage claim in Delhi. So, I had to file a delayed baggage claim. The whole process was a nightmare as there wasn't enough staff available to help. Nobody knew what information to provide. After struggling for a couple hours, they filed a delayed baggage report and they told me I'd be receiving my bag within a couple days. After a couple of days, I called them and they told me that they didn't know where the bag was. So, I started calling them everyday. It would take me a couple hours of calling before they would pick up the phone. The phone operators never had any information about what was going on. One operator told me that the air india flight was not being operated anymore!!! I also sent several emails to the email provided on the delayed baggage report. But they never responded! After 10 days, I received a call from a local airport. They told me to come pick up the bag. I was surprised as the Air India people had told me that the bag would be delivered to my home. As I had a family emergency at home, there was no way I could travel a couple hours to the airport to pick up my bag. So , I told them that I would be filing a police report for stolen bag if they didn't deliver my bag. After several hours, they called me to let me know that they are sending the bag with someone to my home. On Air India's website, it is mentioned that there is $50 delayed baggage compensation if the bag is delivered after 24 hours. I have been trying to contact Air India customer care to get my compensation, but no one responds. I have been sending them emails every day without any luck. I recommend everyone to avoid this airline like plague. I am never flying with them again."

My flight would fly on July 2nd at 1:30am, but they delayed 3 hours first then delayed for ove night 3rd July 2:30 and we did fly by 4 am, and it supposed to be direct flight but they  lay over at Ahmedabad airport for 4 hours and  told us for only 1 hour and half. We basically waited 25 hours on airport with no hotel accommodation. They didn’t provide water and blankets till we asked on 2nd July. 3rd July we argued with staff and manager and they agreed to give us lodge and food.  I would never fly again Air India and not recommend this airline ever."
284,July 2019,Hyderabad to Newark via Mumbai,Family Leisure,C Kahala,3rd July 2019,1,na,1,1,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,Horrible Service," We had a local connecting flight from Hyderabad to Mumbai (scheduled departure for 10 PM and scheduled arrival for 11:30 AM) and then we had an international flight from Mumbai to Newark (scheduled departure 1:30 AM and arrival around 5 PM India time). Very bad communication skills with customers- For our Mumbai to Newark flight that was already delayed by 12 hours (it was scheduled for July 2nd 1:30 AM). We finally arrived in Mumbai around 10 AM. While the flight attendees were going through the security check, the Air India staff informed us that our flight to Newark would leave at 2:30.  Later on, the Air India staff told us that our flight would actually be leaving at 2:30 AM not PM. Not only is our original flight being delayed by 25 hours, but Air India did not correct its customers when they were continuously feeling relieved over false information.  As an airline, it is their duty to be clear to the customer as to when the flight is leaving and being clear with that information especially when they are aware the the flight attendees are on a consensus different from the fact. Horrible Service- In our first flight, from Hyderabad to Mumbai (left at 11:30 PM) , we flew all the way to Mumbai spent 1-2 hours in the air there and returned back to the Hyderabad airport at 3 AM because the flight had no place to land and apparently because of weather. Then, after we returned to the Hyderabad Airport, they kept us in the flight until 7:30 AM and at 7:30 AM we finally left for Mumbai and arrived at 9 AM. This means we stayed in an airplane for 6 hours when we should have only spent 1 and half hour in the plane for our flight. During this entire fiasco, the Air India staff only provided us with a biscuit packet with 2 biscuits and a lunch voucher that only worked during a horrible time. How is one lunch voucher and some biscuits suppose to last us for 17 and a half hours? "

286,June 2019,Mumbai to Newark,Family Leisure,A Nishal,2nd July 2019,1,na,3,2,1,2,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,save yourself all this trouble,"Mumbai to Newark. Due to the short length of the runway at Mumbai airport and incompatibility of Air India, they always remove passenger baggage without ever informing them. They use a very common excuse ""bad weather"". So don't be surprised if you realize at your destination that your baggage was removed and never arrived with you. All other airlines are perfectly fine to land and take off from the Mumbai airport and you never hear any excuses from them. After realizing that you and several other passengers reached their destination without your baggage, the real fun (or frustration) begins. You will realize that Air India has only one phone number for their customer service contact which is the real deal. Average wait time to talk to a representative is over 60 min based on online search (I'm not exaggerating, in my personal experience these were the timings: 96 min, 118 min, 72 min and 130 min). Well after these wait times, you'll end up talking to the most idiotic morons on this planet who probably hate the entire human race. They no idea about anything related to Air India and no respect to listen to what you want, let alone help you. The frustration continues as these reps have no connection to the baggage department and then ask us to get a mystical ""complain number"" before they can look into our case. After calling the customer care for the fourth time, I was told that the number for US baggage department (973-242-0078). Now, I called them over 10-15 times over a period of two days and no one picks up the phone. The fun part is their voicemail box is full and not surprisingly you cannot leave any message or ever get that mystical ""complaint number"". Wrote emails to all departments of Air India including the baggage department. Still waiting for a reply. It's been three days and I'm looking for the lost baggage for me and my parents who travelled to the US and sill have no response from Air India. Please save yourself all this trouble and choose any other decent airline over Air India (even if its a few hundred dollars more pricy)."

Save yourself trouble and never fly Air India. I had a horrible experience with them twice when flying Economy which is why I stopped flying with them and picked Emirates instead. Unfortunately had to book a last-minute ticket and didnt have a choice. This time I hoped the experience will be better since I was flying Business. I am thankful that it was United who issued my tickets and were reliable enough to help me. Air India CS was a nightmare to deal with. Couldnt help. They couldnt find my record, they couldnt assign me a seat, they couldnt confirm anything. Not to mention I was on hold for an hour before they answered the phone. It was United Airlines who put in an hour to communicate with them and help re route me when my flight got cancelled."

Don’t fly Air India unless this is your only resort. 1) I was traveling alone with my twin 3 year old daughters. They offered no support during the flight. I smiled more than they did. 2) I asked the hostess for water upon boarding and she told me to look in the seat pockets. No such thing was found. The seats were in horrible condition when we arrived. No one had cleaned after the previous flight. 3) No inflight entertainment. Everything was broken. 4) Calling the hostess is a useless exercise. Don’t bother waiting. 5) The arm rests were broken and cracked dangerously enough to cause a hazard for little kids. They kept falling on them when they were trying to sleep. 6) They have nothing to offer little kids. No coloring sheets, stickers. Nope. 7) Had booked child meals and was never offered the option while serving. When I complained, they simply said “You should’ve asked for it.” 8) When I whined about all this, one of the hostesses said that she’ll come and take a look. She never came."

Air India flight was supposed to take of at 11 pm IST on 15/06/19 but let us cook in the flight for some 3 hours while mending a technical fault in the aircraft. Then at 2 am the air craft becomes grounded & we are requested to deplane to board another aircraft. Further we are subjected to a security check a second time which also became a harassment as there was hardly any staff to speed up the unnecessary process. The small children had become very fussy by 3 am. Then we boarded the next flight running to the next opposite gate so that flight could now leave in a orderly fashion. But after 15 minutes an announcement was made that the pilots had to deplane because of some regulations. With no further explanations about the current situation, there’s an announcement plz open gate l2. At 5 am with much confusion people started deplaning the aircraft a second time only to surround the two ground staff for some kind of explanation. It was really shameful to explain to the foreigners who didn’t understand hindi that its okay for the National Carrier Of India to behave in such fashion. But my biggest challenge of the night was dealing with my own 3 year old who was so excited, didn’t sleep until 4am in the morning & was constantly asking ‘when’s the plane gonna fly, when do we get on our cruise?"

291,June 2019,Colombo to Kathmandu via New Delhi,Solo Leisure,E Kan,17th June 2019,3,na,4,4,1,na,3,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,Horrible experience," Colombo to Kathmandu via New Delhi. Horrible experience from the start till the end. There were multiple changes to the flight schedule which disrupted our travel plans and we were provided ridiculous alternatives (we are transiting in Delhi and the new flight meant that our connecting flight would depart Delhi even before we arrive in Delhi- how is it even possible for us to catch the flight if we arrive in Delhi at 11am and the flight to Kathmandu from Delhi departs at 9?). So after a gruelling process of speaking to an agent we are offered new flights. This time around we had a one hour transit in Delhi which most travellers would agree is cutting it thin if you consider queues and other unpredictable scenarios. But as luck would have it, our flight from Colombo was delayed by over 30 minutes. We were slated for an 8.20am departure according to the ticket but when we spoke to the staff they told us it has been pushed to 850am. That leaves us with 30 minutes to transit? How can we possibly disembark, go through security and get to our new gate in this time? To make things worse. At 840 people were still disembarking from the plane which appeared to be a turnaround flight. This meant that the staff would still have to clean up the plane and it was evident that our flight would not depart punctually at 850- but at this point no announcements were made whatsoever, not even on the notice screens. Upon checking with the staff they told us it would depart at 905 instead. What on earth is happening? All this while the staff insisted that I would be able to make the flight even though I initially had a one hour transit and the original flight has now been delayed over 45 minutes. That leaves us with 15 minutes. Rather than providing us with helpful information, they gave us flimsy assurance that we would make it even though the odds were clearly against us. This uncertainty is disconcerting for travellers who have actual plans that may need to be shelved if we actually miss the connecting flight. Air India needs to stop selling tickets they cannot guarantee and work on being on time. It makes no sense for a national carrier to be so flaky with their timing."

Air India sorry to say is the worst airline experience any can ever have. I was traveling with my son and to make it easier instead of 2 suitcases of 23kg each I chose to carry 1 suitcase of around 28kg. While going to Paris I travelled in Emirates with same luggage allowance and had smoothest check-in. But for my return flight they did not let me check in because I had one suitcase and asked me to either make it in two bags (which  I didn’t have on Paris airport) or pay for excess. Even on requesting and telling them I have 46kg combined allowance for both tickets on same PNR but they denied stating I have to pay if I am beyond 23kg or I need to find my solutions and come back to them for checking. The air hostesses in flight were least interested in service. The headphone of my seat and my neighbours weren’t working and even after multiple requests they never even for once got time in a 9 hour flight to change our headset and thus no entertainment for us. Our flight from Paris to Delhi gets delayed. After customs and immigration the luggage drop off counter is a small crowded counter. No proper queues and Officers are the most rude people you will encounter. They at the last moment before dropping our luggage asked us to check in the liquor bought on duty free. We had to take out clothes from our bag and put bottles inside on the counter which was badly crowded and unprofessionally managed. Upon arrival in Mumbai after almost 15-18 hours and waiting for almost 40 mins for our luggage we are told that our baggage is left in Delhi and will come in the evening flight and will be delivered only after 1:00Am. On telling them that this delivery time is not acceptable they day they can only deliver that time or next day but when we told them there wont be anyone at home as we will be at office. The executive there told me that its my problem not hers. In all this was the worst experience in terms of an airline I can ever had.
