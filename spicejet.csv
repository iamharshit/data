1,October 2022,Delhi to Bangkok,Solo Leisure,L Kayran,5th November 2022,1,na,4,3,2,1,3,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,never travel again with this airline," I was travelling from Delhi to Bangkok through Spicejet flight, and it was my worst experience. I had to wait 10 hours because of the delay in flight, I missed my next connecting flight also from Bangkok to Surat Thani due to their delay from Delhi. Also they delayed first only for 4 hours, and then kept delaying 4 more times. Although they arranged dinner for delayed passengers, and i was told by the receptionist of that restaurant in Delhi airport, that this type of delay is very common with SpiceJet. They messed up my whole schedule for the next day. I missed my meeting, my next flight, and lost my money of next flight ticket. Will never travel again with this airline!"
2,November 2022,Goa to Chennai,Solo Leisure,Faizal Ahamed,1st November 2022,3,na,4,1,2,1,2,Economy Class,2,1,Trip Verified,Horrible experience," Horrible experience, flight was scheduled at night 21:00, received notification in the afternoon that flight is rescheduled to 22:00 hrs and again received notification by evening that flight is again rescheduled to 23:00 hrs. After check in Goa Airport, again further flight is rescheduled to 0000 hrs. First time I am traveling in SpiceJet and it is worst"
3,October 2022,Dubai to Amritsar,Family Leisure,Anas Rafique,29th October 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Not Verified,Try to avoid them as much as you can," Always had bad experiences with SpiceJet but still have to travel because of sector and flight time limitations. But they keep on amusing you every time you fly with them, if you think your last flight experience was bad, they make sure the next one is worst. Last flight they left my luggage in Dubai. This time flight delayed by more than 12 hours and the worst part is no one is there to address the customers, the staff are hiding somewhere in the airport. Try to avoid them as much as you can. They should be the last option. Prefer a bus over them."
4,October 2022,Patna to Bangalore,Solo Leisure,A Parmesh,27th October 2022,1,na,1,na,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,Yet another day in SpiceJet glory," Yet another day in SpiceJet glory. My flight gets cancelled precisely 24 hours before (They haven't heard of advanced communication). Note I have a connecting flight the next day from Bangalore to London. Now in a panic, I try every single number for customer care only to be dis-connected saying we are busy (they haven't heard of a call queue). Finally, I scanned through the cancellation message a mail and it reads - you can get a refund or reschedule. I thought maybe they had automated everything and I would be able to book something on the same day if I follow the link - surprise surprise they take me for a complete fool (and for that reason every single customer). After you follow their interface it says your money will be refunded in 21 days and there is no option for fight change. I want my money right now in 1 day in fact in 5 minutes the way you looted it while SpiceJet looted it while they gave an illusion for a service. I wonder why the Indian aviation authorities and customer services are not looking in such malpractices."
5,October 2022,Dubai to Delhi,Couple Leisure,Mandeep Gujral,15th October 2022,1,Boeing 737 Max 8,1,na,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,The worst flight I have flown with,"The worst flight I have flown with, airline has no sense of responsibility towards their customer satisfaction and they don’t value their time. I have taken a return trip flight with SpiceJet and both the times the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours. No communication was sent by the airline. When I asked one of assistant boarding staff to give the email ID of their supervisor, she clearly said that she don’t know the ID and during the flight the cabin crew were not co-operative. SpiceJet is very frequent in news for their delays and flight issues, still no actions are taken from their side. I think the Managing Director and his team should look into this or else SpiceJet should restrict their business to India and close their international flights."
6,October 2022,Port Blair to Chennai,Couple Leisure,Joy Choudhury,5th October 2022,1,na,3,na,3,na,3,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,Spicejet flights are delayed., Always delayed due to technical issues. I wonder why only Spicejet flights are delayed. Its has become a habit for such airlines to operate without bothering customer service and satisfaction.
7,October 2022,Goa to Hyderabad,Family Leisure,S Praveen ,1st October 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,SpiceJet calls me a day prior to inform the flight is cancelled,I had my flight booked for 1st October from Goa to Hyderabad. The flight time being around an hour. SpiceJet calls me a day prior to inform the flight is cancelled and I have to take an alternate flight (Goa - Delhi) (Delhi - Hyderabad) the flight time including lay over is more than 10 hours. I am travelling with 2 kids. Very very bad. Don’t prefer SpiceJet.
8,September 2022,Ahmedabad to Delhi,Business,Walid Lahoud,15th September 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,doesn’t care about customer satisfaction, It is a shame that companies like this are still allowed to operate. The flight was announced with delay and there is nothing you can do. They mention to you one hour delay so that you don’t freak out but at the end you don’t know when you are flying. On top of that you as very rude staff that really doesn’t care about customer satisfaction. If you ask to be booked on an earlier flight even with another airline they laugh at you. Never again and I advise all visitors to India to avoid them. They lie to you with a smile and they keep you sitting on the side until you break up
9,August 2022,Chennai to Delhi,Solo Leisure,P Sernah,26th August 2022,1,na,2,1,2,1,2,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,gave me such a bad experience, I travelled in August. Firstly the temperature inside the flight was not good. Sometimes they were increasing the temperature so much that I felt suffocation at times. Sometimes it became so cold inside. Secondly on landing we were inside for about 30 minutes because they did not pen the door. Overall a 3 hour flight gave me such a bad experience. Never travel through spicejet.

Both on ground staff and inflight crew seemed capable, efficient, friendly and pleasantly helpful.  The quality of service was excellent. The toilet was clean. The meal provided was fresh. No hassle and no delays at any point before, during or after the flight. I did not have to wait more than a couple minutes for my luggage after landing. Overall, I had a very satisfying experience."
11,August 2022,Patna to New Delhi,Family Leisure,Sonam Lohani,21st August 2022,1,na,1,na,1,1,4,Economy Class,1,na,Not Verified,I was forced to pay extra for 3 kg, Yesterday I travelled in SpiceJet flight sg8391 from Patna to Delhi with Infant. Two days before boarding the flight I contacted SpiceJet customer care to ask about luggage. Allowed weight for infant because it was not mentioned in the ticket. SpiceJet is basically playing with their terms and conditions and incorrectly charging the customer. I was told to go to the link https://corporate.spicejet.com/tnc.aspx point number 14 where it says that passenger travelling with infant are allowed to query 7 kg extra but the lady on the boarding counter clearly that the terms and condition of SpiceJet has been updated and their customer care is not aware about it. The terms and condition now is that mother travelling alone will be allowed 7 kg extra. It seems but they are making their own policy standing on the counter and she told me if I don't pay this amount she will put my luggage back outside the counter. I was forced to pay extra for 3 kg although I was in weight limits what was told to me by customer care of SpiceJet and whatever it was told to me on the board accountable was completely incorrect and not mentioned anywhere in the terms and condition of SpiceJet. It seems that the employees of SpiceJet just play with the customers by making their own terms and conditions on basis of their assumptions. The manager of of boarding counter was very rude she was not even interested to speak to us. They clearly said that if I am paying money extra for just take the luggage away from here. 
12,August 2022,Bengaluru to Pune,Solo Leisure,L Neiran,16th August 2022,7,na,5,2,3,na,3,Economy Class,4,na,Trip Verified,fare was very low ," I paid 1,400 INR extra to upgrade to priority premium at the check in counter. For the equivalent of 20 USD I got a sandwich, an OK instant coffee and the pleasure of boarding first and sitting in the first row (the seat was a standard seat). The flight left on time and the cabin crew were friendly. The fare was very low so no complaints."

I was travelling with my senior citizen mother and was quite troubled to rebook another flight after my flight has to be cancelled. Also no support to file my claim, for which i have insurance and i just needed 'no show confirmation' from airlines, but they never provided, only excuses"
14,August 2022,Dubai to Mumbai,Family Leisure,Lionel Agostini,3rd August 2022,1,na,na,na,1,na,na,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,SpiceJet refused to board us," As we arrived at the gate on time for our Dubai - Mumbai flight, SpiceJet refused to board us for no apparent reason. I deduce that this company practices overbooking. Not happy to have made us miss this flight, this action has simply deprived us of holidays, my family and I, since we also missed our 2nd connection for Thailand and by the same, the organized trip that we had planned and paid for . All because of the SpiceJet representative in Dubai. Shame on him and this unprofessional company  Alors que nous sommes arrivés à la porte d’embarquement à l’heure pour notre vol Dubai - Mumbai, SpiceJet a refusé de nous embarquer sans raison apparente. J’en déduis que cette compagnie pratique le surbooking. Non content de nous avoir fait loupé ce vol, cet agissement vient simplement de nous priver de vacances, ma famille et moi, puisque nous avons aussi raté notre 2eme correspondance pour la Thailande et par la même, le voyage organisé que nous avions prévu et payé. Tout ça à cause du représentant de SpiceJet à Dubai. Honte à lui et à cette compagnie peu professionnelle"
15,July 2022,Jabalpur to Delhi,Family Leisure,Apoorva Dube,30th July 2022,1,na,na,na,2,na,na,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,my flight has been cancelled, I booked a flight one month prior to my departure. Four days before the actual commencement date i get to know that my flight has been cancelled and Rescheduled for the next day. When i called the customer helpline they refused to provide me any help other than refunding the amount or scheduling the flight for the next day. When i asked them to transfer my ticket to the nearby airport they even refused to do that. They were asking to pay the balance amount for the other flights even though when the fault was from their side.
16,July 2022,Patna to Pune,Couple Leisure,R Agarwal,6th July 2022,3,na,2,2,1,1,3,Economy Class,3,1,Trip Verified,Below average flight ,"Below average flight. Recently I travelled in SpiceJet on 06/July/2022. I have travelled twice with this SpiceJet but I made a mistake giving this airline a second chance. Every time SpiceJet flight is 40-50 min late so as to avoid the 60 min mark so as to evade any penalty. After deboarding, the luggage took forever to come and due to it (delayed flight+ delayed luggage) I missed my connecting train for which I had paid a hefty amount in tatkaal tickets. It's mandatary to pay and choose a seat before web-check in. "

18,June 2022,Leh to Delhi,Couple Leisure,V Lakis,20th June 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,each time the flight is delayed, Most pathetic airline. I was travelling 2nd time and each time the flight is delayed. No help and support for delayed on airport. We were just waiting for hours to depart on the flight.
19,June 2022,Mumbai to Chennai,Family Leisure,Gulshan Kumar,11th June 2022,1,na,1,2,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,SpiceJet turned out to be the nightmare," I booked my flight tickets with this airline and that decision to choose SpiceJet turned out to be the nightmare! First and foremost, the airline added a stop (Jabalpur) at the last moment without seeking any consent from the traveller. I booked my flight for 8th June 2022, non-stop from Mumbai to Chennai. Had to postpone my journey as my wife is pregnant and she couldn’t take a 5 hours since SpiceJet added a stop thereby routing my journey from Mumbai to Jabalpur to Chennai and making a 2 hours direct journey to a 5 hours journey. Left with no other option, I had to shift my journey date to 9th June. Reached airport and there started another another round of drama. Ill mannered, rude and arrogant ground staff at the counter made me stand for 30 mins and then she finally came up with a form which stated that if any things goes wrong with my pregnant wife’s health, the airline will not be responsible for anything including any expense incurred in health. Me, my wife and my 3 year old son- we all were allotted a different seat numbers. Even after requesting multiple time, that lady refused to give us sequential seating arrangement. At last, I had to request my fellow passengers to change the seats (they were kind enough to accept my request). Highly unprofessional, rude and arrogant cabin crew. I am a frequent traveler but I haven’t faced such incident in my past."
20,June 2022,Delhi to Jabalpur,Family Leisure,S Laghari,10th June 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,There is absolutely no empathy for the customer,"SpiceJet has horrible service and reschedules the flight without thinking about the convenience of its customers. I had booked an early morning direct flight from Hyderabad to Delhi which takes about 2.5/3 hours as I had whole day program in Jabalpur. It rerouted the flight through Delhi with a stopover at Delhi for 8 hours making me miss the whole of the day program. Now a couple of hours before the flight time which was to start at 5 pm, it has further delayed the flight by 5 hours making me miss the evening program also. This has happened with Delhi to Jabalpur flight in January 2019 as well when they postponed the flight by 7 hours. Why would anyone book a early morning unless one has some work during the day. SpiceJet has ruined the whole program I had, morning as well as evening, not only at Jabalpur but also at my base location because I had not planned any work due to upcoming travel. There is absolutely no empathy for the customer. They should have tried to book the passengers in other flights or planned something else."
21,June 2022,Belagavi to Mumbai,Solo Leisure,Sanjay Tarale,8th June 2022,1,na,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,Very bad experience," Very bad experience with SpiceJet today.

The entire staff team was so helpful, and nature was so humble. The attentiveness and politeness were thoroughly professional. I highly appreciate your staff and their professional behavior."
23,May 2022,Delhi to Shirdi,Business,Sunil Kumar Khetarpal,30th May 2022,1,Boeing 747,1,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,There was utter confusion and no clarity,"SG 953 on 19/5/2022 Delhi Terminal 1 to Shirdi International Terminal. The flight was scheduled to land at Shirdi at 4.50pm. Instead, the flight landed at Mumbai at 5.30pm. Announcement was made just before landing at Mumbai. Reason given was storm at Shirdi when actually there was no storm and 3 different flights from Chennai, Tirupati and Vizag (including one ATR) landed around the same time. This was confirmed from local authority at Shirdi. Passengers were in the aircraft for more than 3 hours in Mumbai, during this period there were only 2 announcements, 1st announcement after 1 hour of landing in Mumbai that flight will be taken to Nashik as it could not land in Shirdi after dark. 2nd announcement after 3.5 hours was that passengers were given 3 options: Option 1: stay at Mumbai for the night and go to Shirdi next day. Option 2: Go to Shirdi by bus. Option 3: Go back to Delhi and fly to Shirdi next day. There was utter confusion and no clarity. Passengers lost their patience and naturally got furious. We were deboarded in Mumbai airport around 9.00pm. It took one hour to collect the checked-in luggage as different ground crew announced different conveyor belt Nos (No 1,4,14 and finally 13). Ground staff signed and put stamp on the boarding pass of the passengers after writing full refund of the to ticket charges. On requesting for refund through mail, SpiceJet authorities refuse to refund citing the reason for rescheduling of flight (mail from SpiceJet attached). This is totally misleading information and mismanagement by SpiceJet treating their customers as fools and commodity. SMS/Mail from SpiceJet was about cancellation of the flight which was not correct. The loss of time, mental stress, fatigue and poor communication and misinformation by the Pilot can not be compensated in terms of money. I had already blacklisted SpiceJet earlier because of their poor service.. No wonder SpiceJet is on the verge of collapse and shutting down looking at their quality of staff, meals, aircraft and service. A complete failure of structure, process and outcome indicators. "

The ETA was 11:50 a.m. and at 13:55 p.m., the flight is yet to take off. Apparently the systems have had a ransomware attack, which is why they couldn't take off on time. My recent experience with SpiceJet in the last few months have all been delayed. While I waited with the other passengers at the boarding gate, multiple Indigo flights left. Spicejet couldn't care less. "

27,May 2022,Srinagar to Mumbai,Couple Leisure,T Merchant,23rd May 2022,2,na,na,na,na,na,na,Economy Class,1,na,Not Verified,worst customer service," Spicejet has worst customer service anyone can imagine. I made an advance booking for May 29 2022, but eventually had to get cancelled due to medical reasons. They asked me to forward documents and said they would waive off charges. Eventually the only solution they could offer me was an E voucher that too valid for 180 days. I kept requesting them if not refund then at least give me validity extension cause I won't be able to travel for another 10 months. But all request and mails to higher departments had no effect on them. They stuck to same solutions. I would urge people not to book in advance with them as they have the most stringent rules for the passengers."

There was no leg space. We (me and my wife) had to sit for 2 hours in the same position. On top of this, we were assigned the last seat (36th row) and the seats weren’t recliner. No space behind. Buses provide best and comfortable seats these days. Very disappointed with SpiceJet. I wish I never get to travel with this carrier in my future."
33,April 2022,Dubai to Delhi,Family Leisure,Manish Mukhija,30th April 2022,1,na,2,1,1,na,2,Economy Class,1,na,Not Verified,extremely disappointed with the experience, I am extremely disappointed with the experience I am having with SpiceJet. First the flight was rescheduled 5 times between yesterday and today morning. It started at 8:15 am from Dubai instead of 22:40 PM yesterday. Wait time at airport was extremely long for the flight to take off. To my surprise I did not receive my bag at the airport for such a short flight and no transit in between I have an important function to attend tomorrow and there is perishable stuff in the suitcase. SpiceJet service and handling has spoiled my entire trip and left me in very difficult situation. I just called their customer care number. Wait time was close to 1 hour for an agent to pick and there was no definite response when my luggage will be loaded and when I will receive. Looks like airlines support staff is clueless.

37,April 2022,Goa to Delhi,Couple Leisure,Aruneeta Srivastava,11th April 2022,1,na,2,1,1,1,1,Economy Class,1,1,Trip Verified,never had such a bad experience," I have never had such a bad experience with any Airline. I am a 6 month pregnant woman and on 10nd April their staff was just utterly ignorant. Me and my husband were trying to check in our luggage, my husband was in longer queue and I stood on the new counter, the lady who was checking in told me that I should wait while other guys check in, I am not in a condition to stand for long so I told her I am pregnant and first in queue, she made weird faces and tried to ignore that's where my husband had to intervene. There were no courtesy whatsoever. Second, while we were on flight, the hostess didn't give me any instruction even though I told her I was pregnant. I paid for the food and beverage for both me and my husband, and our name wasn't there on the list, there was a long hassle to prove that we paid for the same. Although the Airhostess offered us the same later but proving that you have paid wasn't really a 5* experience."

These guys know how to loot the money from customers. Never in my life have I paid for my laptop bag. And they charge for duty free weight. The ticket was of 6k inr and they charge me 5k for my laptop bag which was only 5kg. And the worst part is they ask for money at the last spot where we have to board the flight. So that the passenger is not left with any other option.

I had to catch a plane from Goa to New Delhi. However, by mistake I booked my flight from New Delhi to Goa. I had lost all my hopes of retrieving my money but their employee helped me greatly. Even though it was a commercial line, she kept guiding me for around 40 minutes. Not only did she help me save around Rs. 17,000, she advised me step by step throughout the call on how to carry out the process. I'm deeply indebted to her from the bottom of my heart and really congratulate them for having such a caring and helpful agent. Thank you so much for your support and cooperation SpiceJet."

They count your luggage at per person instead of weight. No service at all. The crew doesn’t provide proper snacks if you pay for it at time of booking the flight. At the time of snacks they gives you 2 biscuits and a 10 rupees juice. When we demanded tea or coffee they make lame excuses. They charge extra for luggage without checking their weight. Worst flight ever. I am not travelling Spicejet ever again and won’t recommend to anyone.

We paid for priority check in and Spice Max but we literally had to beg for all the services we were entitled to, in fact their staff asked us to get into the regular queues and wait saying there are no priority services, we literally had to fight for it. Also this airline makes you pay extra for what you shop from duty free! They weigh your cabin baggage again after check in before you enter the flight and ask you to pay. Horrible experience and wouldn’t recommend it to anyone!"
47,January 2022,Mumbai to Srinagar,Couple Leisure,Tanvi Sharma,9th January 2022,1,na,3,na,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Not Verified,literally the worst situation,"I had a flight scheduled on 8th Jan' 22 from Mum to Sri (SG 944). Due to bad weather conditions in Srinagar, the flight got cancelled which is understandable. The flight was almost full. So instead of getting us on another flight the next day, they told us that all the direct flights for the next day are cancelled and are also full for the upcoming 3 days. They are then providing us indirect flight via Delhi after 2 days. I am still following up with my accomodation issues in Kashmir for change in dates and not sure if i will get a refund for my hotel bookings. Also, they are not adjusting us for direct flights and i have to additionally budget my stay option in Delhi for one night as well. How can an airline be so ignorant to the travellers since we are the reason you guys have business. My cancelled flight was almost full, and they could have simply scheduled another flight for the next day. But they are now giving us indirect flights at the charge of direct flights which is generally higher. The staff was lying to the crowd that the direct flights are cancelled and giving us indirect flights. And at the same time, they were taking a few passengers to the side and booking them on direct flights. I was one of them but they later told me that the direct flight just got fully booked but don't tell the rest of the passengers that the flights are operating. This is literally the worst situation any airline has put me through."

The flight was scheduled to start at 3.15 pm. They preponed it to 3 pm.

My father-in law who was the passenger who was returning from Pune to Hyderabad was a senior citizen and was returning back after attending the death ritual of a relative had a harrowing time with arrogant staff who were not willing to help him. They said they will refund the airfare but fingers crossed. Show me the money and then I will believe. Some thing is wrong with SpiceJet. Lots of problems. Too many flight delays, cancellations.

I bought the gift card from their site, and while applying it is showing transaction error. After contacting them, they said it will take 3 working days to resolve the issue. It's been more than 10days now, they have not taken any action, flight rates are now sky high and they are not even ready to refund the gift card amount. This is a trick to lure their customers to prepay for the gift card and then not let them use it so that after a certain period of time they can charge them more for the same trip."

But the cabin crew were helpful and the food I purchased onboard was also of good quality. Once I arrived at the airport and began boarding, everything went well. But the trouble is that my original booking was of a 4-5 hour journey duration, but the airline changed the route and connection, so today I am travelling for more than 8 hours, which is a lot for a domestic flight. Also, there were several revisions of route and time before the actual journey, which got me rather stressed."

The customer care initially told that it will take 15 days to get the refund. 15 days withholding the money for cancelling the Flight for their own benefit (other 2 airlines were operating on the same day, same route, same timing) shows their commitment to the customers. The worst part is even after 15 days no refund received.  Even after 26 days the refund is not received."

I wrote to customer relations, asking them, since there is no alternate flights available, its our daughters first birthday and she was so nagging and I requested them atleast provide a lounge or room considering the infant as it is 6+ hours. I got no response for that until 12th September. When you call customer care, one have to nearly wait 40+ minutes to speak to respective person in-charge. Again, via return, the direct flight has been cancelled. We took a flight from Goa to Bangalore and Bangalore to Chennai with 3+ hours waiting time in Bangalore.  There was a time change again, from Goa to Bangalore and we re-booked our cab. We had a very worst experience with Spicejet. All they say, the change is due to operational reasons.

Worst is that they kept offering refund to passengers who are in transit. Finally they put us on the next days flight which again we had to insist upon.

I wish there would have 0 star rating to give because they don't even deserve 1 star. They changed our flight timings at first due to which we had to change our other events timimg. Later on airport our baggage was not loaded. We had to wait 2 to 3 days to have our baggage. They were not even sorry for the same and the airport staff was very rude to help us in that situation. As a part of compensation they promised us 1500 voucher written on the attachment top. But still not received it. Even after several calls and emails they are not replying anything on the voucher status.. Not answering the calls either. Dont know why they charge so much money for such a worst service. I will never recommend using Spicejet ever to anyone. I had a worst experience ever with the airport staff.

I observed that hand baggage weight limit policy of 7kg is applied to only certain customers. I have been waiting in the que for boarding and in front of me many customers gone with higher weight and in my turn I had 2 kg extra and I have been instructed to pay 60Dhs per kg for excess weight. I honour their terms and conditions but my question is that the policy should be uniform to all customers. I don’t understand the logic behind different terms according to the face value of customers. They are favouring some customers according to their wish and relaxed for more than 10kg. When I tried to ask this to their ground staff, they were so arrogant and impatient. They kicked me out from the que and rudely told if you don’t want to pay throw your item. I have been travelling in this sector for past 17 years and used many carriers. Never experienced such behavior earlier. When I entered the flight, again surprising that there is no space to keep my hand baggage. They have collected such a heavy amount and I had to keep that items below my seat compromising leg space.  When I shared my experience to their customer service team later, they come up with copy paste of standard reply format justifying their terms. Be aware about their standard so that you will not have disappointment."

With regards to what I can carry and what I can't carry also guided me in check-in and hand luggage which made me really feel at ease as I was a single lady passenger and with the pandemic situation so I was scared and all. Apart from that I really loved him for his excellent communication skills, open-minded and friendliness, his professionalism, his passion for his work, excellent work ethic, courtesy, his manners, friendliness and open-minded attitude towards cultural awareness and he knows how to treat a passenger like a guest in his own home with respect without any discrimination unlike what I saw at Mumbai airport how poor people are treated. He also had put priority and transfer tag on my luggage so it gets loaded separately as promised by him, excited to see the bag come out 1st and that was very sweet of him. He is an excellent example of what customer service is. Though he didn't do my check in he has left a mark on me and he is the reason I wish to fly with Spicejet again and see more staff like him and his excellent habits"

After all this drama I finally boarded the flight 15 mins early, if they haven’t made this an issue I would have boarded half an hour earlier. I really recommend to please learn hospitality from other airlines, I also travelled with Vistara, Indigo, GoAir and Air India, if their customers are late they actually look for you and make you board the flight without making it an issue.

However we would like to draw your attention to one of the bad incidents. Our seats were 3A and 3B and entered the flight almost at the end of the boarding process. We were trying to accommodate our hand baggage within the available space within the overhead compartment. In between one person occupying seat 1F started shouting us not to touch his bags! We were thinking that it is a crazy passenger but later on found from the crew that it is the captain of Spicejet. It was a shocking moment and we have never came across such an arrogant airline staff, whether national OR international carrier. We are not able to understand how can Spicejet afford such a bad person as your captain especially during this COVID season. We tried to complain to the crew but it was of no use since the captain is above all of them. "

I've done this with many other airlines in similar situations. However, today was a nightmare. Apparently i had to pay for checking in the above mentioned or carry them all with me. I was utterly shocked of the lady at the counter for behaving in such a rude way. She told me to open the stroller and take it back. So i had to carry the 7kg hand luggage of my baby, 7kg hand luggage of mine and my daughter with the stroller in my hand. And by the time I reached the plane i was truly exhausted. I had back ache and plane was hot. It had only paid food and the seating wasn't comfortable either. What is the point in paying for the infant if they don't have a seat, luggage allowance or food. The plane got delayed, I was starving and tired. And when I got off the plane the stroller wasn't there.  I had to wait for the stroller after I've received all my suitcases. So what was the point in making me suffer if it all went in the same plane. Worst experience ever. Never choosing this airline ever again."

It's via Pune and now the halt has been increased from 30min to 6hrs. There is no use of utilising flight as it's wasting my whole day with a halt of 6hrs. Now while cancelling this return ticket of around Rs 4.2K, te refund amount calculated is just Rs 572. So it's like I had money and I have wasted this with SpiceJet. Kindly review your service and enhance the customer service/booking interface or at least provide clarity to customers. Please don't lie.

The steward was very kind to first ask me if I had taken food before getting me a pill and lukewarm water (this matters because medicines have to be taken after food and with lukewarm water and not every flight steward/stewardess bothers to make sure if the passenger has eaten something and if the temperature of the water is right). After this, the stewardess approached me a second time to enquire if I was doing okay and if I needed something which I thought was a very sweet and generous gesture from their side and I was so satisfied and happy because I had never received that kind of treatment on any flight before. I know it is the job of an air host/hostess to attend to the passengers, but to date, on every flight I've been to, none of them have come back to enquire about my health after attending to me once. This gesture, even though it was small, made me feel so contented and I'm pleased to have had the chance to be a passenger on board this flight. Thank you SpiceJet and thank you cabin crew of SG140."

Then they decided to only provide a credit shell for the outgoing flight, not the return flight (no airline cancels an outgoing flight but keeps the return flight - completely against all procedures), finally they added a credit note that is not even valid for a year. When we tried to use the credit note, however it was not possible to apply the note on an online booking, all helpline numbers for the company are not active, and no one replied to an email sent requesting immediate assistance. They are the worst customer service, I would never ever fly with them, they do not adhere to their own guidelines nor to the civil aviation customer rights."

Ticket cost INR 6000+ and also I purchased extra baggage allowance for my 2nd check-in that cost INR 12000+ and total cost is INR18205. Little did I know that I am not qualified to carry my 2nd check-in that cost INR12000. So I contacted customer service and apparently it's not refundable. So I asked them cancel the entire ticket and cancellation charge cost INR4000 even though I purchased their own so called insurance. Their check-in baggage allowance weight is 20kg (44lbs) which is the least of least of airlines I flew so far. I am a very frequent flyer and have been flying from last 15 years in western countries and never ever this happened in any other airlines.

Once the payment is done' they do not care about it's customers. I have been mailing them for weeks trying to contact them to cancel my flight or at least reschedule it but they are not responding at all. The customer care staff is the worst they do not really care about their customers at all. All that matters is money. Once the payment is done they do not care about anybody. Even at this time when the world is fighting Corona they expect me to either board in the flight else I will be refunded on 380 rupees for tickets costing 16000. In case I want to reschedule my flight I will have to pay rupees 3000 per passenger which is illogical. They keep telling us their policies which I believe are not for such epidemic situations. But they won't help us in any way.  I will never travel via SpiceJet again and I recommend never ever to choose SpiceJet even in the worst conditions.

There is no way to cancel a booking through their web site, and their phone numbers only worked once out of the 30+ times I tried them!

After calling and emailing for at least 20 times the past month they keep asking the same questions without any progress. We're still waiting for our money back. Also the way they handled the communication around the corona virus and the forms you needed to fill was unclear. We ended up waiting after arrival with the whole plane grouped up filling in extra forms that we didn't receive from SpiceJet.

I usually fly spicemax most of the time to have convenience and to save time but that generally doesn't happen. I have tried to provide feedback multiple times through their portal about their spicemax program but mostly it seems they are least bothered about customer feedback or customer satisfaction. Almost 90% of the time spicemax doesn't mean anything for SpiceJet crew. I believe their crew lacks proper training or they don't care for people onboard. I believe they should focus to make this program more robust so that people would feel like paying for the additional facilities. If they treat the same to all than why would one pay the premium to avail additional services.

We were declined boarding passes because they said we need to arrive 45 mins prior and despite of begging the staff to give us our boarding passes they were rude.  We were told that they had already started boarding on the flight and we would not be able to reach the gate in time. This was a really horrible experience. They told me that I would have to pay 1 lakh and 20 thousand rupees for just the return ticket which I of course did not buy.

As this was a transfer flight to my final destination in Kolkata, the process was very smooth and boarding started well ahead of schedule. Again this flight by a former Jet Airways Boeing 737 and the crew seemed affable enough. I had pre booked the non veg and veg lunch meal for my family members which consisted of a chicken and egg biriyani as the non veg option and veg biriyani as the veg option. The food also had a bun and a cup of yoghurt and even though the meal was not bad, the quantities seemed to be on the lesser side. Landing was in time however I noticed that as the passengers were de-boarding, the crew did not thank the passengers and they had their backs turned instead of thanking the passengers and this was maybe the only negative in what was by and large a very good flight. The pre booked meal on Spicejet seemed to be of more quantity compared to other rival low cost carriers operating in India but still if one has to purchase in flight, it can get expensive as it starts from 250 INR onwards. Even though LCCs are in the habit of maximizing revenue as much as possible, one can be smart about this and perhaps have food before the flight. The flight itself was pretty nice."

For this morning service, there was massive lines for the baggage drop but eventually was able to drop the checked in luggage. It is important to come well in advance as one could easily miss their flight due to the serpentine nature of the queues. Before dropping the bags, it is important to print the boarding passes / bag tags from the kiosks. The flight was operated by a former Jet Airways aircraft, so the seating was more on the spacious side. Departure and arrival was on time. The crew were also good. I had asked for a glass of water only to be told that she would be giving me later but never did. Thankfully there was another crew member who provided the water. Unfortunately, for my aunt, the crew never really provided her any water when she made a similar request. As the flight was full, the crew managed to slowly get the service done but they did it quite well. While de-boarding, the crew thanked all the passengers which was good. When it comes to low cost carriers, one should not have much expectations except from getting from point A to point B efficiently."

All reasoning fell on deaf ears. Most horrible experience as I am sure my things will break and the airline will shrug off their responsibility.

We recieved message and call on that day morning 10:30 as the Flight has cancelled and book for alternative. The team showered regrets for inconvenience and suggested to Travel via Chennai or Hyderabad the same day for few and other next day.

But when they started confirming they said only few can get direct Bangalore flight next day and others has to travel via other cities.

We checked for Direct flight for others and surprise to see there were lot of seats vacant and they were not willing to confirm other day. Since, we had aged and infant people in group we requested them to allow in direct as there were lot of empty seats.  When we entered aircraft and took off saw there were still many empty rows I was like why the team did not allocate my other team for Direct flight earlier and pushed them with hands up for all our request earlier to confirm.

All other flights namely indigo were departing at their times normally only spice jet planes somehow didn't take off, thats just so problematic. Then again I received a message on my phone at 1 pm that it was going to take off at 2:30 then finally it took off at 3pm. When we landed the crew were least bothered to know the belt number the luggage is going to be available at, they said it was going to be at belt-8 but it was available at 9 which i found out on enquiring separately, after waiting almost 15-20 minutes at Belt-8 which stopped.

Our problems started at the check-in desk, where the woman checking us in visibly rolled her eyes at us when we approached the counter. When we arrived in Kochi, I was informed that my bag had been kept in Mumbai because of a powerbank (which the check-in lady did not ask us about). Now, I understand why they have this policy, and that's not the problem I had with SpiceJet, as I realize that part is my fault. The problem was how SpiceJet customer service handled it. No information, hanging up on me every time I called to check the status of my bag, needing me to send the appropriate paperwork multiple times before removing the powerbank and sending me my bag (which took over 48 hours). I don't understand why it's so difficult to simply remove the powerbank (which I gave permission to do) and send the bag. Yet for some reason, the people who work for this airline are completely incompetent. Not only that, but I received a message on WhatsApp that my bag was arriving on a certain flight, so I drove 1.5 hours to pick it up. But when I arrived, the bag was not on the flight! Instead, it was on the next flight which landed 3 hours later. Since we were about to leave Kochi and go to Alleppey, I had to wait for it. I spoke with the people working at the SpiceJet counter in Kochi airport, who didn't seem to care at all and kept saying ""well maybe it will come tomorrow"". I made it clear I wasn't leaving without the bag, and told them I'd wait for the next flight. I left to get some food, and when I returned, no one was there -- the counter was closed. Fortunately I was able to get the terminal manager to help me get my bag, but if they weren't going to be there, why the hell didn't they just say so when I told them I'd be returning? Truly a horrendous experience with SpiceJet customer service, both in person and on the phone -- completely unhelpful in every way possible. The second time we flew SpiceJet was no better, as we were charged double the price of our ticket to change our flight by one day (even though online it says you only have to pay the difference of the fares, which is a lie). On top of that, there were over $100 of hidden fees added to the ticket price, which we were not informed about until it was time to pay. We were told we either had to pay it, or we'd lose our current flight AND the new reservation. Nothing about this airline makes sense, worst customer service I've ever experienced. "

Why would the airline staff mislead a fare-paying passenger? More surprises. After a 2 hour delay, the flight crew was busy providing sample drinks and indulging in small talk with a group of passengers without any consideration that the rest of the passengers were trying to get some sleep. After all, it was past midnight. I don't think it was too much to ask of the flight crew to service the needy passengers without boring or bothering the rest about their drink choices."

The airline policy clearly states that each passenger is allowed cabin bag of maximum 7kgs and hand bag free of cost. We were a group of 13 people, and accordingly every passenger is allowed a cabin bag and a hand bag free of cost, but staff was hell bent on making us pay extra for the hand bag (which is essentially my purse). He was rude, and has no idea what he was talking. We have been frequent flyers with Spicejet and usually the staff is very polite and considerate. We choose Spicejet for their hospitality and are loyal customers since years.  We wasted our time and energy and faced a lot of inconvenience. This behavior is unaccepted and intolerable. "

I registered complaint with them in writing, after running from pillar to post taking over an hour. 5. In the process I missed my pre-booked transportation to Pattaya (where I was travelling) and had to take a cab on-the-spot. I received my baggage afterwards coordinating with them.

Flight SG 3219. Flight was delayed by 2 hrs 45 min. Your crew started serving food and beverage. I purchased a cup of tea by paying Rs. 100. But I found the tea was cold. I brought it to your crew, a lady. She asked me whether I had sipped the beverage. I answered, of course. But she didn’t believe me. To my utter surprise, she asked another co-passenger, who was also having tea, whether his beverage was hot enough. He responded, might be, 'yes'. She then turned to me and said, he is saying the tea is hot enough. To my utter disbelief, she poured some water from the pot. I didn't say anything but kept the cup full of tea or to be precise some lukewarm water and a piece of biscuit. I could have argued that my co passenger purchased the beverage when she began serving and I purchased while she was coming back from one round. But I didn't say anything. But I wonder how could a lady pour some water, maybe to her belief hot enough, to the cup of tea without even thinking that what would be the taste of the beverage. But one thing I must tell you, you can cheat your passenger but you dont have any right to insult them. I am regular flier on this route but never faced such rude and insulting behaviour from any cabin crew."

SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Bengaluru. This was a very good flight where everything went very smoothly from check in using the kiosk machines to the baggage drop, everything was flawless. The boarding started before the scheduled time which was a plus point and the flight was very full. One slight disadvantage is the need to pre pay the seat while doing online check in. However, if one arrives at the airport early enough one can select their seat preference without needing to pay the additional cost. But then this is a practice most LCCs do. The plane itself was used formerly by Jet Airways, so the seat pitch was on the more generous side which was well appreciated for a trip that was lasting 2 hours and 50 minutes long. We took off before departure time, the crew were proactive and personable enough with the fellow passengers when it came to the food / drinks. The pilots also announced and kept us updated regarding the flight path. Arrival was also well before the scheduled time and collecting the baggage was done quickly without the need to wait for long. Overall I'd say that on flights with longer durations, having a seat pitch which is more on the generous side really helps a lot. Would I consider flying SpiceJet again? If there is a good deal available."

SpiceJet manged to be delayed (departure time) on 5 out of 4 planned flights: one flight was so delayed that I would not catch the connecting flight in Delhi - and I was not let on board. Thus I had to stay in Bangkok for one more day (no compensation for the hotel whatsoever). The next day, the plane was overcrowded - forget the extra leg room! Also, staff were always checking x-times if I was entitled for something to drink. It was an unpleasant and embarrassing experience. I will try to avoid SpiceJet at any cost. You do not get what you paid for in many terms. Losing time, energy and money when you cannot fly on the planned day is absolutely not worth it."

First they are taking undue advantage of your situation and charging heavily for any excess baggage (approx 1400 INR per kg). I paid 15k for my excess baggage and they did that for most passengers and later all of our baggage was left behind as they did not have enough space in the flight and no information was provided to us. They just keep making money by accepting all there is to take. Upon landing in Pune they informed us what they have done and delivered a lot of false promises about refunds and compensation to pacify us. Later when I followed up with their customer care they didn't even bother to reply; cause they know they have already got the money and later when I complained again they bluntly refused to pay any compensation or refunds. They are extremely unprofessional and liars and cheats. Don't fall for their scams like me and from my experience I will tell you better to pay 1000 bucks extra and travel with other airline who don't do all this funny business and have better professionalism.

In particular, the staff on Kolkata-Chennai segment was very helpful, courteous, and pleasant. It's the crew that makes the airline, truly. On the other hand, the systems of SpiceJet are broken. Two examples: (1) On this same route, I had a ticket with all three segments under the same Record Locator. However, since a flight was modified by the reservation staff, their internal system showed them under different locators so I had to manually collect baggage and check-in baggage at every point - three check-ins, three baggage collections, and two re-check-ins! This needs to change. Airlines exist for customers, customers don't exist for airlines. (2) On a previous reservation that was cancelled by SpiceJet and refunded in full, the full refund was issued as a new transaction rather than reversal of the previous charge. Due to Exchange rate difference, this resulted in a loss of $7.95 to me, without having received anything other than headaches from SpiceJet."

I was stuck in traffic and I knew I wouldn’t be able to make it before 45 mins, so I called the airline and they said they’d mark my PNR and send their staff to help me with the stuff. On reaching the airport and literally pushing everyone aside turns out there was no spicejet guy there to help us out. Moreover when we reached the check-in counter they refused to accept that we had our PNR nums marked and said that they couldn’t help us at all. Later, the senior executive came and spoke to us. Honestly, she couldn’t help us with the situation at all and later when we told her about the call center person who told us she’d arrange help, the senior executive asked for her name and asked us to call her back and if we couldn’t do that we could book another flight. She had a lot of attitude and just showed that she was least bothered in helping us. They have stupid officials at their call center who just know what to say or what to do. I’d strictly recommend anyone reading this to never use Spicejet as they have horrible services. This is just one of the most disastrous experiences I’ve ever had with any of the airlines. Later on, we had to book another flight to get back so yes we chose indigo which is a way better flight than spicejet. We had to book our tickets at the airport itself and since the ticket counter was very crowded the indigo official took us to book our tickets, took our baggage and made it very hassle free for us."

The planes are not the best or even good ones. They seem too old for 2019. Inflight service is alright. Staff have the same attitude in the air as on the ground.

Thereafter, we were told to come back at 3pm as our baggage would be flown in by then. Even though SpiceJet caused the issue, they refused to have our baggage delivered and they refused to compensate for costs to go to and from the airport (which is quite high in Dubai). When I got back to the airport to pick up my baggage at 3, they delayed further and we waited until 4.30-5 to get our luggage. The SpiceJet manager at Dubai airport refused to speak to us and was literally hiding in the SpiceJet office. Look, these things happen, but it is the airline's responsibility to do everything it can to ensure no further trouble is caused. I have never had such a disgusting experience with any other airline and will never, ever travel with SpiceJet ever again."

I have had travelled in Spicejet before and with my experience I already had a feeling that my Spicejet flight might be late; this is why I had demanded for the facility. But even then, they didn't put any priority tag on my luggage and my luggage arrived 15 mins late at the Guwahati airport. My first flight was 40 mins late, the next one being 20 mins late. I think spicejet needs to improve their services and at least provide the required services for the paid stuff, if not free. Never travelling with spicejet again, unless that'd be my last option."

With spice jet you should be careful while checking in, yes I understand 30kg is your limit, but I saw a gentleman being asked to remove even 1 kg extra. It's of course the airline policy but this was certainly something a airline staff could have handled better. Having checked in without any fuss, luckily, I was  excited as I was taking my 1st international trip with spice jet.  No one was allowed to check in hand luggage over 7 kgs, which includes duty free spirits and other items bought.  10000 rupees for hand carry without warning is insane."
261,July 2019,Pune to Cochin,Couple Leisure,Ujjval Jain,7th August 2019,1,na,1,na,1,na,1,Economy Class,1,na,Trip Verified,our whole trip was ruined," I had booked four tickets from Spice Jet to fly from Pune to Cochin.  It was a pre-planned holiday and two out of four were on their honeymoon. We had everything booked and scheduled - the cab, itinerary, hotel bookings and everything was paid in advance. Spice Jet being such a reputed and big airline spoiled the whole holiday with their unprofessional ignorant attitude.  We reached the Pune airport at 10 a.m. on 29 July as our flight was scheduled to fly at 11:25 a.m. and we issued the boarding pass on the kiosk and the same was sent to us on WhatsApp by Spice Jet team. We proceeded for the security check. Upon reaching there the security officer asked us to report at the check-in counter, at the counter we were shocked to know that the flight had been delayed by four and a half hours and later got cancelled due to some technical issues. Spice Jet officials straight away denied that they cannot do anything about it and we have to see something else on our own. After a lot of heated argument they agreed on shifting us to the immediate next flight from the Pune airport but we were given wrong information about the available flights too. There was a Go Air flight at around 1 p.m. which we agreed on taking to and later on they refused us to accommodate in that flight. We did not know what to do as we had a schedule to follow right after our landing in Cochin.  When we requested them for some other options, we were told there was a flight at 4 - 4:30 p.m. Indigo flight which is a direct flight to Cochin. We agreed as there were no other seats available in any other flight. But when I checked it online, it was via Bangalore that was taking about six hours to reach Cochin. Had I not checked it, they would have shifted us there with this misinformation. This is such an unprofessional behavior. If the flight is cancelled last minute then ethically they should support their customer who is suffering because of the last minute cancellation rather than giving up on them and providing them with wrong information. Then I checked the online flights available and saw Go Air had an available flight from Mumbai at 5:20 p.m. which was landing at 7:35 p.m. which was still suitable as we had time to reach the hotel at least. Spice Jet team first did not agree to this then after requesting to SpiceJet senior team member that our entire money will go waste, earlier he refused but after pursuing him a lot he booked us in the Go Air flight from Mumbai. The Spice Jet person after booking it told us that your bookings are done and we’ll offload you from the airport and you go and get a taxi on your own at around 11:45 a.m. Pune to Mumbai taxi fares are high, we were not prepared for it and also we were not liable to paid it too. When I requested they out rightly refused, after a lot of argument they agreed for the taxi. We took our flight from Mumbai and landed at Cochin at 7:30 p.m. Our whole day was spoiled because of the last minute flight cancellation. We are middle class people, we plan the holidays in advance and take a fixed budget. After this, our whole trip was ruined."

The Flight was delayed by 3 hours. The real problem that my family faced was that Spice Jet offloaded their baggage without informing them, so my wife kept waiting at the belt for 2 hours at the belt at Delhi Airport only to be told that the baggage will come with next flight. What is this?  No airline ever offloaded our baggage before without our permission. With falling standards, this Airline will not fly for long."

No hassle. Then I was asked to pay for my laptop bag weight as well, which was unjustifiable. Never ever I paid for my laptop bag as an extra carry on bag in last 10 years. No other flights charge such an extra bag fee. I agreed to pay for the laptop bag as well, but asked the spicejet staff their IDs which they declined to provide, they get all our information and unwilling to provide their IDs, which would help me to complain against them. Our co-passengers were too carrying carry on bag above 10 kgs, but we're singled out. "

Reached the airport at 6.30 pm for the flight 605 departing at 8.50 pm, initially announced a 1 hr delay, then 3 hrs, then 1 hours, then been informed an early morning flight of 6 am. They waited until the passengers forcefully cancelled their tickets in order to minimize their refund @ 500 rs per hours.

First of all, we were put in the plane 20 minutes late, before waiting on the tarmac, in a hot plane, for well over an hour. Once we finally took off, the onboard service was okay. I didn't buy anything since I had ate at the airport however, so I cannot comment about the food. On my return flight back to Hyderabad, I was put on an older Dash-8, which meant smaller seats, no reclining, and harder everything. Before/after this flight, I flew on IndiGo's ATR-72 from Tirupati to Hyderabad, which was so much better. If you want a cheap flight in India, don't choose SpiceJet, choose IndiGo, or even Air Asia India. Sometimes, Air India will be the cheapest option, which is a total win for me on a domestic flight, but not so internationally. I am unfortunately flying SpiceJet's 737 later this month, I'm just hoping that the entertainment streaming will save my sanity."

Worst experience with an airline so far. Travelled from a Jaisalmer and we were told that the flight would be delayed by 1h then ended up being delayed by around 3h. As a result of that, we missed our connection at Ahmedabad which was reasonably spaced at 3h from us landing. Upon landing we went to SpiceJet kiosk and staff was incredibly unhelpful telling us we need to buy new tickets to our destination. We ended up outside the airport, not being able to go back in arrivals or go into departures as we did not have a boarding ticket. We now need to wait for 4h until something is sorted by our insurance, in the heat, without water, food or toilets and with no help whatsoever from Spicejet. Poor airline with poor customer service.

Went through private security and was in the lounge in under 3 minutes. Boarding was through buses.  Upon boarding, a choice of lime water or coconut water was given followed by cold towels. In the seat pocket, reading materials of newspapers and some magazines were present along with a small water bottle. Flight crew were super attentive and looked after us really well. H After take off, menu cards were handed out, which is great for a short 2 hour flight to Delhi. Lots of options to choose from and their dessert Tiramisu was extraordinary. After finishing of the meals, choice of tea and coffee was made along with choco-chip cookies. Good coffee! Finally, before landing a hot towel service. Overall, a great service in SpiceBiz, looking forward to my next travel with the same again. The crew made our travel so comfortable and constantly kept looking after us onboard. SpiceBIZ is a great addition to the airline and it’s a unique experience in itself."

First flight got delayed by 1 hr 35 min. And later departure time changed to 4:30 instead of 2:55. There is no proper reason from SpiceJet staff why flight is getting delayed - earlier they told departure time 4:10 then said 4:30 and actually flight took off at around 5 AM. Due to this delay, I missed my flight from Mumbai to Bhopal. I complained to spicejet by email but they just say due to operational reasons it got delayed and no compensation can be provided at all. After few email exchanges they don't even bother about customers' concerns. I found their cabin crew is also rude and does not know how to treat their customers in flight. Never recommend anyone to fly in spicejet unless there is emergency and no other option. Better to pay little more in other airlines but at-least you will reach your destination on time and have peach of mind."

Extremely cramped seats, even for a person of my height (5). And seats are dirty, too. No kind of effort seems to have been put into maintenance. I understand that this is a low budget flight, and we can't expect much leg space, but the amount of space between seats is painfully little, for more than an hour of journey. If you compare this with other low budget flights like Indigo, their spacing is much better."

Almost 70 baggage were offloaded due to overloading of flight reason. Then we were stranded at airport for almost 3hrs, the representative was arrogant, irresponsible and incompetent to even manage the issue. Today after 3 days there is no update on my luggage. Spice Jet is not only a low cost airline, i guess its also a low or no Service airline as well. I will surely make to avoid to use this airline in future. There has to be some system in place to take strict action on such irresponsible behaviour of the airline staff. We understand there will be issues, but managing them professionally and updating the customer about them should be their priority."
